            "Amit Shah - BJP is hoping to strike gold in West Bengal - Telegraph India$ 23.12.20$Civilization has been under the spell of the yellow metal since time immemorial. The myth of the city of gold — El Dorado — refuses to fade away. Politicians — members of the Bharatiya Janata Party are a case in point — are also in the habit of talking of a golden past or, when elections come calling, promising a golden future to the people. So the Union home minister’s vow to turn Bengal into Sonar Bangla within a stipulated time frame is only to be expected in this season of elections. Amit Shah’s contentions about Bengal’s challenges cannot be brushed aside. The flight of capital compounded by years of militant trade unionism as well as political corruption has blighted the prospects of an economic renaissance. Yet Mr Shah’s assurance needs to be taken with a pinch of salt: the BJP’s record of running India in the last six years is far from glittering. Under Narendra Modi’s benevolent vision, the nation’s slide on critical parameters has been steep and, hence, worrying. India clocked its highest ever unemployment rate with the BJP at the helm; per capita income is expected to fall even below that of Bangladesh; the deepening agrarian crisis, manifest in the farmers’ protests, remains unresolved; radical experimentation in the name of reform — the demonetization exercise is a classic example — has decimated the vulnerable segments of the economy. Social strain complements the nation’s economic decline. India’s plural, accommodative spirit has been weakened by a surge in majoritarianism. Equally discernible has been the inertia of critical institutions responsible for keeping an aggressive executive on a leash., Significantly, the BJP seems eager to replicate its template of division in its attempt to claim Bengal’s political crown. Even though he was evasive about the contentious National Register of Citizens, Mr Shah spoke about the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a controversial legislation, which has been spiritedly opposed by large segments of people in Bengal. The dissenting voices did not belong to minorities alone. The BJP’s is also hoping to gain political capital by raking up the issue of minority appeasement, yet another polarizing claim. Its promise to rid Bengal of corruption is a bit rich, given the fact that it has roped in defectors from the Trinamul Congress who are accused in multiple cases of financial irregularity. The BJP is hoping to strike gold in the state, but that need not assure Bengal of a golden future.\n",

            "Indian National Congress (Congress) - The BJP economic libertarianism underlies the farm laws - Telegraph India$ 23.12.20$The remaking of a nation is typically a process that unfolds at a glacial pace over time. A few bellwether events however stand out, both as catalysts of change as well as signs for posterity on how the nation was remade. Siraj-ud-Daulah’s defeat at Plassey, the reconstruction amendments after the American Civil War abolishing slavery, Nelson Mandela’s release from Robben Island are some events to which historians have attributed special significance in shaping the future course of history of their respective nations. , Whenever India has a government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, there is a narrative that the nation, founded on values of the freedom movement helmed by the Indian National Congress, is being slowly remade. Central to such a narrative is the cultural project of the BJP — asserting the rightful place of Hindus in the nation. That project is well-documented and such a national remaking is core to the raison d’être of the BJP. But with the passage of the three farm laws in Parliament, the prime minister has demonstrated a definitive intent to remake the nation economically. Sure, there have always been murmurs that BJP governments have traditionally been best friends of big business. But that is something that can be truthfully said of all major political parties in post-liberalization India. Yet, the farm laws are the boldest and most candid declaration by the BJP that New India will not be founded on a mai-baap sarkar but rather with the hard work of the individual farmer supplemented by the enterprise of the private sector. This is as bold as it is surprising. , At its core is a seriously contested economic argument for farmers’ prosperity. That Indian agriculture is not as productive as it can be is an acknowledged fact. Small land-holdings, the lack of credit available to farmers, outdated farming methods, scores of middlemen and a skew towards paddy and wheat owing to selective government price support all contribute to this state of affairs. The new laws choose to address one dimension of the problem — the dominant role of the State in Indian agriculture. , To this end, one of the new laws ends the monopoly of the government’s agricultural produce market committee that runs the local mandi. It gives farmers and traders the freedom to trade in any trade area, including on an electronic platform. The second law, in tandem, empowers farmers to enter into contracts directly with buyers bypassing middlemen who are an endemic feature of Indian agriculture. The third law, an amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, is most revealing — it limits governmental intervention in the agricultural market only in extreme cases of war, famine and so on. This, as the government has been at pains to point out, has nothing to do with the minimum support price for paddy and wheat, which is not provided under the Essential Commodities Act. Nonetheless, it is a clear sign of the determination of the government to be a facilitator rather than an active price-setter and regulator of Indian agriculture., This is a distinct vision of how Indian agriculture can grow from the State-supported model in vogue at present. Central to this vision is the growth of new agri-businesses, which are expected to compete with State procurement processes. Whether such businesses will lead to greater benefits for farmers or worsen their lot is a hypothetical question that can only have hypothetical answers at present. But the bottom line is this — the new laws provide options to farmers to either sell to the State in the mandi or to private producers outside it. Simultaneously, it opens up the sector to a range of private actors whose enterprise is expected to make the system more productive. This combination of individual choice and invitation to enterprise is not primarily an economic argument for reform — it is an ideological one. , Economic libertarianism of the kind that underlies the farm laws — remove the State from the equation and let the market show the path to prosperity — has largely been tangential to traditional Indian right-wing thought. This conflation between the cultural right and the economic right in recent times is a fundamentally American idea born out of a distrust of the State and the championing of limitless individual freedom. The Indian right has never shared this distrust of the State or advocacy of individual liberty. In fact, with the exception of the Swatantra Party, the major intellectual strand of right-wing politics in India, the Jana Sangh and now the BJP moored by the philosophy of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has been that of cultural conservatism together with a swadeshi State that plays a dominant role in the economy. In some senses, that is classic conservative politics — as Eric Kaufmann has recently written, “Most voters lean left on economics and conservative on culture but no one represents them.” This is whom the BJP has traditionally represented, more so with the diminishing political smartness of the Left in India. , But with the farm laws, the BJP has taken a distinct libertarian turn on economics. As a party avowedly resolute about reform, it could have chosen to reform Indian agriculture in a number of ways — conclusive land titles for agricultural landowners would have been a game-changer that would increase the creditworthiness of farmers in one stroke. That it chose to whittle down the role of the State, something that it hasn’t done despite indications that it would do so to the MGNREGA or to the National Education Policy, is an unraveling of the traditional understanding of the Indian right. From a culturally conservative party, it is also becoming the Indian variant of the Republican Party of the United States of America — imbued by the doctrinaire belief that small government is the way to prosperity., This is why the protests against the three farm laws enacted by the National Democratic Alliance government are the sternest test yet of the resolve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of remaking the nation. The protests against the CAA-NRC, almost a year to the day, despite their largescale support and longevity, made no headway in their objectives. This was unsurprising given the focus of the protests was support for minority groups that are politically unimportant for the BJP. But the farmer protests are an entirely different kettle of fish. After all, the kisan in traditional political terms is the annadata, to be given free electricity and exempted from payment of taxes. Electorally, given that agriculture is the primary source of livelihood of 58 per cent of the Indian population, the vote of the farmer is the holy grail. When faced with such largescale farmer protests, the prime minister was quick to offer compromises ‘with folded hands and bowed heads’ — clause-by-clause readings, amendments and assurances that the MSP would not be touched. Only time will tell whether this is smart politics to fulfil his new economic vision or an unraveling of the vision itself. , Each of the prime minister’s offers demonstrates the knife-edge the nation is on at present. In their resolution lies the ultimate answer on whether the farm laws will be a bellwether event in the remaking of the Indian nation or simply yet another footnote in the glacial changes always afoot around us. The Singhu and Tikri borders are no longer mere outposts — they are the sites where history is being written., The author is Research Director, Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.Views are personal\n",

            "nrc - Didi piles CAA heat on ‘cheat’ party - Telegraph India$ 22.12.20$Mamata Banerjee on Monday called the BJP “a cheatingbaaj party (a party of cheats)” over Amit Shah’s apparent shifting of the goalpost on the citizenship matrix and spoke against any of its three components getting implemented in Bengal., On Sunday, the Union home minister had said the rules of the amended Act were yet to be framed because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the process would start once vaccinations began. On a nationwide NRC, he said: “Let the first step happen.”, A day later on Monday, the Bengal chief minister told the media at the state secretariat that BJP leaders could do or say “anything” for politics. “The BJP is a cheatingbaaj party. In English, we say cheater. The politics of the BJP leaders is that for politics they can do anything, say anything.”, “Since they passed the CAA, we have been opposing…. They cannot decide the fate of the citizens. Let them decide their own fate. We are against the CAA, the NPR, the NRC. None of those has been withdrawn yet…. We will keep fighting the battle and not allow anybody to go out of this country,” said the Trinamul chief amid signs of the movement against the citizenship tripod making a resurgence., Before Lok Sabha polls last year, the then proposed CAA was a plank from which the BJP sought votes from many, including the Matuas. The Matuas, lower-caste Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, determine the electoral outcome in at least 30 Assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats of Bengal., Now, with Matuas getting restless over the delay in the CAA’s implementation, BJP national general-secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya had earlier this month promised it would be implemented from January., On Monday, BJP’s Bongaon MP Santanu Thakur said in Raiganj that Shah should clarify to the Matuas what its plans on the CAA were. “It is important that the Act is implemented before state elections. Any delay in the process will have its… bad effect,” said Thakur, reacting to Shah’s remarks that were a departure from Vijayvargiya’s “January” promise., Mamata in her response to the issue iterated on Monday: “The Matuas, for instance… they are already, very much, citizens of this country.”, Mocking Shah, she said: “Sonar Bangla (Shah’s promise for the state)… does he know what sona (gold) is, what rupo (silver) is, what tama (copper) is? I hope he knows the meaning of armoury, arms, riots, communal, secular?”, “Most of the things he said yesterday, total lies, garbage of lies. I will issue a point-by-point rebuttal tomorrow (Tuesday),” she added. “Speaking for a political party, it does not behove a Union home minister to furnish falsities as facts. I would request Amitji, you are the Union home minister. This does not look nice, if you peddle the lies prepared by the party without fact-checking…”, On Shah’s defence of his ministry’s transfer of three IPS officers from Bengal in the wake of an attack on BJP chief J.P. Nadda’s convoy, Mamata said: “...From my limited experience as a seven-term MP and two-term CM... there is a Constitution and there is a convention. Such provisions are applied only in times of Emergency,” she said. “Have they announced such a super Emergency in Bengal?” They want to scare officers and we will not cower before them, she said., Resignation accepted, Speaker Biman Banerjee said on Monday that he had accepted Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari’s resignation as the latter had submitted the letter conforming to rules.\n",

            "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - CAA ‘not forgotten’: Zubeen Garg   - Telegraph India$ 22.12.20$Popular singer-composer and social activist Zubeen Garg used the concluding function of the 8th North East Festival 2020 here on Sunday night to announce that he has “not” forgotten about the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act and that the protest against the law will be virtual this time., After his first song, Zubeen brought up the law that is set to dominate campaigns for the 2021 Assembly polls., “The CAA is coming. Everybody can change side but not me. But this time, it will be different. This time, it (protest) will not be on the road. It will be through mobile... a virtual CAA protest,” Zubeen said in his uninhibited style., He added, “I was hospitalised. I had a neuro attack. I have forgotten 50 per cent of things, but I have not forgotten CAA... Will not accept CAA. I am not a person to give up on anything without completing it. Are there any BJP or Congress (members) here? I don’t care. I will talk about it (CAA) as we go on.”, The CAA is an emotional issue in the state. Those opposed to the law see it as a threat to the culture and identity of Assam and the Assamese people. They want the law scrapped because it makes securing Indian citizenship for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan easy., As his performance was streamed live, the announcement was greeted by Twitter users, fans and followers. “Only one person can openly protest against #CAA on such a big platform like North East Festival. And that person is Zubeen Garg. So, much respect for this man. Much love,” a Twitter user said. , The reaction was understandable because Zubeen was at the forefront of the anti-CAA protests in Assam last year before it turned violent on December 11, leading to the death of five persons in the government crackdown., Soon after, Zubeen took ill and flew to Mumbai in March for advanced treatment and to recuperate. The coronavirus-induced lockdown saw Zubeen return only in May. He maintained a low profile amid reports of his growing proximity with the ruling dispensation., In August, Zubeen’s meeting with agriculture minister Atul Bora and the latter’s announcement that they have requested the singer to become the brand ambassador of his department triggered a backlash on the social media. The move was seen as “giving up” on a cause Zubeen had led from the front for months. , Such was the ire that he was verbally attacked here by a group of youths “with beer bottles in hand” in August, apparently for his growing closeness to the BJP-led government, which was in favour of the CAA, leaving the singer upset. His wife had then told The Telegraph that he had not accepted any government offer. Zubeen, too, was seen clarifying he was, is and will remain opposed to the CAA., But these were nothing like his announcement on Sunday night, his admirers said. “It was the Zubeen of old, holding nothing back. The timing and platform he chose to announce the digital protest is also significant,” one of them said., The student wing of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) is observing an anti-CAA week from December 24 to 31 by holding a series of protest programmes across the state., The North East Festival is usually held in Delhi but was shifted to Guwahati for its eighth edition because of the pandemic. Still it saw a healthy participation over two days. Four chief ministers, leading artistes, industrialist and foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla attended the event. Over 1.5 lakh people watched it online, the organisers said., “The pandemic has made us think differently. The earlier editions of North East Festival were having a large audience in Delhi. Very few people watched this edition at the venue, but a huge number watched it on different streaming platforms. People watched it in the US, Singapore, Calcutta, Bangalore, among others,” Shyamkanu Mahanta, the man behind the fest, told The Telegraph., “A digital audience base has been created. It is here to stay. After the pandemic, we might host the fest in Mumbai, Delhi or Bangkok, but we shall also carry on our digital platform to attract newer audiences,” he added., The festival this time focused more on discussions on entrepreneurship, start-ups and tourism. “North East Festival has become most trusted and largest regional platform of NER,” Mahanta said., Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal had on Saturday not only highlighted the tourism potential, cultural vividness and diversity of the Northeast but also stressed the need for all northeastern states to work together to harness the region’s development potential.\n",

            "Amit Shah - Amit Shah pledges to transform Bengal into 'Sonar Bangla' - Telegraph India$ 21.12.20$Union home minister Amit Shah wrapped up his two-day Bengal visit on Sunday evening after launching the party’s campaign for next year’s Assembly polls., A pledge to transform the state into “Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal)”, if voted to power, was the recurring theme of his visit., Shah spared no effort in attacking the Mamata Banerjee government. Accusing the government of many ills, from encouraging illegal infiltration from Bangladesh to pushing the Bengal economy into dire straits, he rolled out a long chargesheet during his two public speeches — one in Midnapore on Saturday and the other in Bolpur on Sunday — and a news conference before leaving., Here are the highlights of what he said and the questions that were left unanswered:, Infiltration, What Shah said: On all the three occasions that he spoke during his 44-hour Bengal visit, Shah referred to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh and accused the Mamata Banerjee government of encouraging it as part of her “appeasement politics”., Shah asked: “Do you think that the Trinamul government can bring an end to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh?”, Questions: The surprise was not in Shah broaching this issue — a divisive weapon in the saffron camp’s armoury. But there was a striking divergence from his pre-2019 speeches as he was silent on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) this time., At the news conference, this correspondent asked him what had happened to the “chronology” he would often mention, saying the CAA would be implemented first and the NRC later rolled out across the country., Shah said the CAA rules were yet to be framed because of the pandemic and that the process would start once vaccinations for Covid-19 began. On a nationwide NRC, he said, “Let the first step happen.”, Bengal economy, What Shah said: The biochemist who was called an alchemist after scripting the Uttar Pradesh success story of 2014 donned the hat of an economist at the news conference on Sunday., He reeled off a wide variety of economic data — from Bengal’s slide on indicators such as per capita income to the lack of employment opportunities in the state — to buttress his claim that Bengal was on the path of decline. He said he was referring to the numbers as he wanted a discussion on the real issues before the Bengal polls., Questions: The concerns Shah raised about the Bengal economy or the human development indices cannot be brushed under the carpet and there is little doubt that there is indeed scope for improvement. However, Shah was silent on the magic wand the BJP would use to turn Bengal’s economy around., The Narendra Modi government also owes answers to questions such as why India’s per capita income is projected, according to the IMF, to slide below that of Bangladesh in 2020. Posers on why India recorded its highest unemployment rate — 6.1 per cent — in fiscal 2017-18 still remain unanswered by a government that came to power with the promise of “achchhe din”., State farmers, What Shah said: He took care to explain that Bengal’s farmers were losing the benefit of the PM Kisan scheme — under which they get Rs 6,000 a year — because of the state government’s decision to stay out of the central scheme for political considerations. He said the decision flouted the principles of federalism., Questions: There cannot be any argument that farmers in Bengal as well as the rest of the country deserve a better deal from the state and central governments. Shah, however, was evasive on questions about the farmers protesting outside Delhi seeking the repeal of three contentious laws that they believe will rob them of their land and livelihood., ‘Outsider’ tag, What Shah said: Shah was bitterly critical of the Trinamul for labelling the BJP “outsiders”. He reminded Mamata, who was in the Congress before floating Trinamul, that Indira Gandhi and other senior national Congress leaders used to come regularly to Bengal. Throwing the gauntlet at Mamata, he said the BJP leaders in Bengal did not need anyone from Delhi to obtain the seat of power in Bengal., Questions: Most BJP leaders in Bengal concede in private that central leaders micromanage the affairs of the party., The Bengal BJP’s Delhi dependence has also grown exponentially in recent months, with a clutch of leaders from other parts of the country having been dispatched to the state for the upcoming poll battle., Nor can Shah deny that a series of gaffes — such as mentioning Visva-Bharati as Tagore’s birthplace — have offered Trinamul an opportunity to attach this tag., Besides, the overzealous effort by the BJP’s central leaders —Shah said in Santiniketan on Monday that he would have been happy to spend seven days in Tagore’s abode — to prove their Bengali credentials have helped Trinamul keep the debate alive., Dynasty and graft, What Shah said: One of the central themes of Shah’s attack on Mamata has been that her primary objective is to keep the chief minister’s chair warm for her nephew Abhishek Banerjee. “She doesn’t think about the 10 crore people of Bengal. Her only aim is to make her nephew the chief minister,” Shah said in Midnapore and Bolpur., He accused the Trinamul government of spearheading corruption in Bengal before promising that the BJP, if voted to power, would rid the state of corruption., Questions: The discourse on dynastic politics is an old one in India and Trinamul alone cannot be blamed for this trend. The BJP too has its share of dynasts — Anurag Thakur, Dushyant Singh, Poonam Mahajan, Pritam Munde, Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma and B.Y. Raghavendra all sit in the lower House of Parliament., Besides, the latest addition to the saffron camp in Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari, hails from a political family that has four lawmakers., The pledge of ridding Bengal of corruption sounds a little rich, considering that some of the BJP's converts from Trrinamul face multiple corruption charges.\n",

            "editorial - Free fall: indices of progress - Telegraph India$ 21.12.20$India continues to perform poorly on global indices of progress. With the largest number of internet shutdowns in the world, India has recorded a third consecutive year of declining online freedom; it ranks 94 out of 107 nations on the Global Hunger Index 2020; and eight states have registered an alarming fall in sex ratios in the latest National Family Health Survey. But even tempered expectations are not enough to cushion some of the other blows. India has fallen two notches on the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index, which measures standards of living, education and per capita income, to rank at 131 among 189 nations. It has also slipped an appalling 17 spots on the 2020 Human Freedom Index to stand at 111 out of 162 countries. , The fact that India ranks higher than Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh on human development cannot be any consolation; more so since the rankings have alarming implications for political and civil rights in the country. India’s unsatisfactory performances on development indicators reveal steep contradictions as well as challenges that are interlinked. Life expectancy, for instance, has fallen in a nation with the world’s most extensive food security programme. Rising malnutrition is being expedited by climate change, which, in turn, has increased migration, widened income gap and posed significant challenges in the paths of girls’ health and education. What is mystifying is that India has elected the same government twice in spite of the nation’s dismal performance on such crucial parameters. This raises interesting questions. Is electoral success concomitant with pledges to improve the health and living conditions of the people? This query is pertinent because Narendra Modi’s successive and impressive election victory has coincided with marked deterioration on the ground — for the first time since 1998-99, India’s declining child malnutrition curve has been reversed, and child wasting has risen rapidly. Meanwhile, the ‘health’ of democracy is suffering as well. The passage of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the stripping of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood and the pushing through of three agriculture laws in the name of reform without representative consultations reveal the government’s unwillingness to accord weight to allegations of weakening constitutionalism. Discouraging data, however, are unlikely to make a difference to a dispensation that has reduced the ideas of democracy and development to aggressive nationalism, a majoritarian ethic and the cult of personality.\n",

When Mamata di was in Congress did she call Indira Gandhi an outsider? Did she use to term for Prime Minister P V Narashima Rao? Is she trying to create a country where people of one state are not allowed in other states?\" he said., He also attacked the Mamata Banerjee government over Bangladeshi infiltration., \"The TMC can never stop infiltration as it believes in appeasement politics. Only BJP can stop it... Mamata Banerjee supports farmers protest but doesn't allow cultivators of Bengal to get the benefits of central schemes. Is this the way to honour the federal structure?\" he said., Responding to a question, the home minister said the rules for implementation of the Citizenship (amendment) Act will be formulated after the Covid-19 pandemic is brought under control., \"Because of the corona, such a massive process can't be carried out. As soon as Covid vaccination starts we will discuss it,\" he said.\n",

Chidambaram on Saturday confronted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has accused the Opposition of spreading lies, with three incontrovertible facts that could leave the government in an embarrassing position., Chidambaram tweeted: “The Prime Minister has once again accused the Opposition of ‘spreading lies’. Here are three so-called lies that he may wish to comment upon:, 1. The AIKSCC (All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee), which is coordinating the farmers’ protests, has said that farmers are selling paddy at Rs 900 per quintal though the MSP is Rs 1,870 per quintal. Is that a lie?”, The Congress leader added: “2. A Delhi court that acquitted Tablighi Jamaat members has said that it is probable that the accused ‘were picked up to maliciously prosecute them upon directions from the ministry of home affairs’. Is that a lie?, 3. The CBI has contradicted Uttar Police police and charged four accused persons with gang rape and murder of the Hathras victim. Is that a lie?”, The Prime Minister has been claiming that his government has implemented the Swaminathan Commission recommendation of giving minimum support price (MSP), which is input cost plus 50 per cent, and citing instances where farmers have gained from the new farm laws. , Farmers’ unions have fiercely contested this, saying that the government was making a false claim by doing a wrong calculation — based on partial input cost instead of total input cost. They have also been saying that most of the items are getting sold far below the MSP., While there is a unanimous view among the farmers that the Prime Minister’s claim of implementing the Swaminathan Commission recommendations was a lie, Chidambaram also said so through his question. , The second issue, about the Tablighi Jamaat being responsible for the initial spread of the coronavirus in India, is also an embarrassment for the government as senior ministers and BJP leaders had, with the help of sections of the media, launched a vicious propaganda campaign to malign a community. Now, various courts have rejected the allegation, absolving Tablighi Jamaat members of all charges., The third claim, that the Hathras teen had not been raped, has also turned out to be a lie as the CBI has filed a chargesheet confirming gang rape. Along with the Uttar Pradesh police brass, many BJP leaders had propagated the no-rape narrative and made unsubstantiated allegations of an international conspiracy., Modi had earlier accused the Opposition of spreading lies during demonetisation and the anti-CAA protests as well.\n",

I have perused the supplementary charge sheet. In view of the same, I take cognisance for commission of offence under Section 124A/153A/153B/505 IPC,” the judge said in his order., The Delhi Police had filed another supplementary charge sheet against Imam in the case in July this year. The police had alleged in the charge sheet that Imam gave inflammatory speeches at several places, including Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University during anti-CAA protests., The charge sheet said that Imam allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt and disaffection towards the Centre and instigated the people which led to the violence in December last year.,  , “The present case has emerged from a deep seated conspiracy which was hatched under the garb of opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill. Earlier even before the Presidential assent, the present accused (Imam) along with his associates were involved in circulating falsehood by canvassing in the Muslim dominated areas about this Bill that the Government of India intended to take away the citizenship of Muslims and also that the Muslims will be put in detention camp,” it alleged., The charge sheet further alleged that “falsehood and rumours” were being continuously spread with mischievous intent that the Citizenship Amendment Bill, coupled with National Register of Citizens (NRC), intended to take away citizenship of Indian Muslims., False messages were shared over social media, pamphlets were distributed among masses, individual, members of societies/NGO’s were roped in to give speeches which made innocent teens believe that CAB would indeed take away the citizenship of the Indian Muslim community., Protests against the CAB and later on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were started deliberately to create a sense of insecurity amongst the Indian Muslim population, it alleged., Imam was arrested for his alleged inflammatory speech at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13 and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India., “In the garb of protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block the highways leading to the major cities and resort to ‘chakka jaam’, thereby disrupting normal life. Also, in the name of opposing CAA he also openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the chargesheet had said.\n",

            "Citizenship (Amendment) Act - Northeast cry to repeal CAA still rings loud - Telegraph India$ 12.12.20$The first anniversary of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was observed as a “black day” by leading student organisations of the Northeast on Friday and from all possible indications, the protest to get the legislation scrapped will only grow in the near future., The North East Students’ Organisation (Neso), comprising the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU), All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), Naga Students’ Federation (NSF), Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), Twipra Students’ Federation (TSF), All Manipur Students’ Union (AMSU), Garo Students’ Union (GSU) and All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union (AAPSU), observed a “black day” by displaying black flags and banners in important public places seeking the repeal of the law passed by Parliament on December 11 last year despite widespread protests in the region., In Assam, five persons died at the peak of the anti-CAA movement on December 12 last year., The Neso said the protest is a message to the Centre that the region remains opposed to the CAA and will keep on fighting for the scrapping of the law, seen by many as a threat to the identity and culture of the people of the Northeast., The law makes it easier for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to secure Indian citizenship., The Lok Sabha passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill on December 9 last year while the Rajya Sabha passed it on December 11 despite widespread protests in the region. The protest, spearheaded by AASU, Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), citizen groups and the Opposition parties in Assam slowed down because of the examinations and the coronavirus-induced lockdown., However, Friday’s protest will see the return of sustained public protests in the region, especially in poll-bound Assam, political observers said., Neso adviser and AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya told The Telegraph that Friday’s protest shows the Northeast was, is and will remain united against the CAA despite the Centre’s alleged efforts to divide the region by exempting areas falling under the Sixth Schedule and the inner-line permit, a travel document that regulates the entry and stay of outsiders, including those from other states., Bhattacharjya said, “The CAA has to go because the Northeast is not a dumping ground for illegal Bangladeshis. We will continue our fight. On Saturday, we will be holding protests in all district headquarters. In Guwahati, we will hold a meeting in memory of the five CAA martyrs. They were innocent people and till now no inquiry has been instituted into their death by an inhumane government. We reiterate our demand for a probe by a sitting high court judge into the deaths.”, The day also saw KMSS members and supporters stage a protest rally in Sivasagar, seeking the scrapping of the CAA and the immediate release of its chief adviser Akhil Gogoi, who was arrested on December 12 last year at the peak of the anti-CAA protests. Akhil said on Friday that the agitation against the CAA has slowed down, which should not happen if the Assamese society has to be protected., A leading anti-CAA protester, Srinkhal Chaliha, said at the protest meeting that Akhil will be contesting in the Assembly polls from Sivasagar and they would ensure his victory by over a lakh votes., Like the AASU, the Coordination Committee Against Citizenship Amendment Act will felicitate the families of the five protest victims so that the people don’t forget their sacrifices at a public meeting to renew its pledge to continue the fight against the CAA which started in 2016, to uphold the secular character of the Constitution. The committee will also seek a thorough probe into the circumstances leading to their deaths., Popular singer-composer Zubeen Garg, one of the leading lights of the anti-CAA movement, also remembered the martyrs in a Facebook post which had all their names — Dipanjal Das, Sam Stafford, Ishwar Nayak, Abdul Alim and Dwijendra Panging — under the headlines “I remember” followed by “WE have not forgotten”, “No CAA” and “Assam Remembers”. By evening, the post had notched up over 18,000 likes and 1,400 comments. Zubeen also urged all users to post a photo having the names of the martyrs., A family member of Stafford, a Class X student, told reporters they are still awaiting justice., In fact, the special investigation team constituted in December last year by the state government to probe the violence that rocked the state is yet to submit its chargesheet because it was awaiting a few technical reports like forensic and analysis of video footage. Two of the original members were transferred after a couple of months., The delay, many say, is perplexing because senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had categorically accused the Popular Front of India, “urban Naxals” and a section of Congress workers of being involved in the violence, at least in front of Janata Bhawan, the seat of power in Assam, during the anti-CAA protests in the city., “Roughly 50 per cent of those involved in the Guwahati violence cases were from lower Assam’s Barpeta, Kamrup, Goalpara and Nalbari districts,” Sarma had said., Sources said the demand for a thorough probe or making the reports of the inquiry held so far will only increase in the coming days.\n",

This is not just our home…This is your home too...You need no new certificate to stay here. Because you are all citizens. You are being cheated with the offer of citizenship through the CAA,” Mamata said at a rally in Gopannagar near Bongaon., The chief minister stayed firm on her stand against the new citizenship matrix. “There will be no CAA...No NRC. It is a ploy of the BJP to push the Bengalis out of Bengal to make it Gujarat,” Mamata said., “If the CAA is allowed to be implemented, they will ask you for your grandmother’s age, grandfather’s date of birth...Will you be able to submit all these?” she asked, adding that the state government had already ensured their rights as citizens by recognising refugee colonies., “The recognition of the colonies by the state government made you a citizen of this country naturally. So you do not need to be at the mercy of anybody for any new citizenship certificate...Nobody can evict you from here, ” she said., Of over 60,000 people who attended the rally at Gopalnagar Haripada Institution Ground, most were from the Matua community, lower caste Hindus who had fled Bangladesh., Wednesday’s rally was significant as Mamata managed to bring together 23 Matua community organisations, and accept their demands, including a state holiday on the birth anniversary of Harichand Thakur, who had formed the sect, and inclusion of only people from the community in the Matua Development Board., Mamata tried to contrast how she delivered on her promises while the BJP only gave “false assurances”., The Matuas had largely been Trinamul supporters since the change of guard in Bengal, but the BJP had since managed to make solid inroads in the community by playing the citizenship card. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won in two Matua dominated seats, Bongaon and Ranaghat, coming as a big blow to Mamata and her party., Sources in Trinamul said Mamata was aware that discontent against the BJP was brewing among the Matuas as the CAA remained on paper with the Centre yet to frame the rules. Some BJP leaders like the party’s Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya said recently that the act would be implemented from January., Later, Narottam Biswas, chief organiser of the Hari Gurchandh Bhakta Matua Mahasangha, said: “Mamata Banerjee is the only one to fight for the citizenship for the Matuas. The CAA cannot be accepted in its present form. It must be simplified unless withdrawn.”\n",

            "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - Movement for change initiated by Muslim women - Telegraph India$ 10.12.20$Gender justice and equality are intrinsic to a democratic society and polity. Various articles of the Constitution, including Article 13, Article 14 and Article 15, uphold these values for all Indian women irrespective of caste, class, ethnicity or religion. And yet, the journey towards gender equality has never been easy in this country. Reform in laws pertaining to marriage and family has been a complex and contentious subject in our religious and patriarchal society., Parliament has framed different laws over the decades in an effort to bring about equality for women. Today, women enjoy nearly equal rights as men, at least legally. But there are exceptions to this; Muslim women lag behind in terms of legal protections. The Constitution grants the right to religious freedom for all citizens. Traditionally, this has meant that laws pertaining to family matters such as marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance, and property would be based on religious texts. This is where complications arise., Historically, women’s subjugation has been passed off as normal in the name of religion by male religious authorities. This has been true for all faiths. Sati, widow harassment, dowry, triple talaq, polygamy — each of these practices has been justified in the name of religion. It is not surprising that the founding luminaries of our nation were concerned about the marginalization of women even after Independence. Jawaharlal Nehru and B.R. Ambedkar were keen to ensure that women attain equality in marriage, family and society. They anticipated the denial of rights to women on one or the other religious pretext or in the name of tradition. They unsuccessfully tried to bring about a secular law in the form of the uniform civil code. This move was opposed vehemently by sadhus and by some political leaders as they felt that this was an attack on our ancient heritage and civilization. The archives of the Constituent Assembly debates highlight the vociferous opposition to such a law to protect women. Society was perhaps not prepared for it and Nehru was forced to abandon the idea. It features as Article 44 of the Constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy. But a way was found in the form of a Hindu code bill to give rights to Hindu women. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and more such laws were brought in. Gradually, Parliament passed amendments to benefit Christian women who now enjoy the right to initiate divorce. Unfortunately, Muslim women were largely left out of the ambit of legal protection in the absence of reform in Muslim family laws that are governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. This law is insufficient and silent on important aspects such as age of marriage, meher, triple talaq, polygamy, the guardianship of children, women’s share in property and so on., Muslim women’s democratic movement against instant triple talaq has been a historic development in the current decade. Since 2011, more and more Muslim women started speaking out against this arbitrary practice. They highlighted that there is no Quranic sanction for such instant unilateral divorce. Ordinary women joined the movement demanding justice based on Quranic values as well as constitutional principles. They openly challenged misogynist interpretations by the self-appointed guardians of religion who had perpetrated an unjust practice for ages. The women not only mobilized Parliament and the Supreme Court but they also educated the entire community and the country. The conservative clergy has come in the way of honouring gender rights granted by the Quran, women were saying in unison. Several women petitioned the Supreme Court and, finally, triple talaq was declared illegal in 2017., But nothing is devoid of politics in our troubled, multi-faith society. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government supported the abolition of triple talaq. In an affidavit filed on the matter in the Supreme Court, the Centre stated that the fact instant triple talaq is illegal in nine Muslim countries reveals that it is not part of the essential practice of Islam and must be abolished. In its second term, the government passed a law against triple talaq, leading to an uproar within and outside Parliament. One MP termed this law as a plan to fill the prisons with Muslim men., Without going into the motivations of the government in bringing about the law against triple talaq, let us remember that the BJP came to power only in 2014. The Quran had called for affirmative action in favour of women 1,400 years ago. Tunisia, Morocco, Indonesia and some other Muslim countries have worked out progressive jurisdiction on gender. Unfortunately, in India, there has been a nexus between political parties and the conservative, patriarchal clergy that has thwarted any effort to reform Muslim family law. Remember how they joined hands to crush the voice of Shah Bano in 1985?, Indian Muslims comprise the largest minority community. The majority of Muslims are poor, educationally backward, and economically deprived. The political representatives lack commitment and competence to alleviate their plight. The community has been in the grip of a conservative clergy, which is clueless on most issues. India has become highly polarized in the last few years. Mob lynchings in the name of gau raksha, discriminatory laws such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the looming National Register of Citizens, harassment through the bogey of love jihad have amplified the sense of fear among Muslims., In spite of the prime minister’s slogan of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas’, the government has done nothing to address the concerns of the community. The conservative ulemas have maintained that religion is the sole prerogative of men. Some sections feel that this is not the right moment to demand reform in Muslim family law. But there is never a proper time for gender justice. The movement for reform initiated and led by Muslim women must be supported by all.\n",

            "Fifth Column -  False pledge: NRC in Assam - Telegraph India$ 30.11.20$Many liberals and self-proclaimed Marxists in Assam held the firm belief — they still do — that the National Register of Citizens will eradicate the gaze of suspicion on ‘illegal’ people. This belief is nothing but an instance of false consciousness, a story manufactured by the caste Assamese middle class and the Assamese nationalist to invoke a spirit of acceptability among people towards the NRC. A bureaucratic exercise cannot be a solution to social malice., The elite among Assamese Muslims also supported the NRC process in this hope, as did a number of ‘miya’ poets. But by the time the NRC list was published last year, Assamese civil society bodies started expressing their dissatisfaction with the 1.9 million people who were left out of the register. The figure was too less for them. , The NRC is far from over. The stories of hope that were sold are fading with every passing day. The anti-foreigner rhetoric has resurfaced, once again. It has been given a new lease of life and has indoctrinated a new group of youngsters into the fold of Assamese nationalism. This has resulted in a toxic mix of jingoism and hatred towards those perceived to be outsiders., Other lives, The recent debate that emanated from the public rejection of the idea of a char-chapori museum by Assam’s health minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, is a case in point. The proposal for a museum, which would reflect the culture and heritage of the people living in Assam’s char-chaporis, had come from the Departmentally Related Standing Committee on Education of the Assam government. The committee had proposed this idea along with another museum for the Gorkha community. The proposal was presented to the legislative house in March; 10 of the 15 committee members who gave those recommendations are from the ruling party in Assam. , Char-chaporis are heterogeneous, non-colonizing spaces that are not inhabited by Bengali Muslims only. The health minister’s resistance reflects not only the sensibilities of the Assamese but also the condition of minorities in Assam. It is evident that Assamese society suffers from ‘sociocentrism’, a condition in which the identity of a pluralist society is articulated through a dominant member of the group. For the caste Assamese, it is unimaginable that artefacts associated with the Bengali Muslim community can be a part of the Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra in Guwahati. Sarma’s remark also embodies a mindset that perceives the Bengali Muslim to be a polluting element degrading Assam’s culture. Hence the need for segregation and the rejection of the idea of a shared space. The rejection reveals the extent of alienation and dehumanization of minorities, especially miyas., Sorry picture, The elements that are integral to the iconography of the miyas being circulated on the social media — a torn lungi, barbed wire, muri, ittar — portray what the French writer, Albert Memmi, calls ‘heterophobia’: the fear of difference, both real and imaginary. There is proof of such fear lingering in Assam. The health minister reportedly blamed the ‘invasion’ of Covid into Assam on Muslims. The chief minister is reported to have noted in a public rally in Bodoland that the ‘Mughal’ assault on Assam continues, and that if we don’t become conscious of it, Assam’s mother tongue will become Arabic. These comments come in the backdrop of the Assam government discontinuing the funding for madrasas in the name of modernizing education. This kind of vilification has coincided with the rise of right-wing politics in Assam. But this should not take away from the fact that antipathy towards minorities has been organic to Assam’s culture., The NRC is not a solution. It is only an instrument to consolidate Assamese cultural essentialism.\n",

            "bilkis-bano - 2020: A year against women - Telegraph India$ 28.11.20$One slot on the ‘BBC 100 Women 2020’ list has been left blank. This is not because there are not enough women in the world who have made a positive difference in one way or another. On the contrary, it is because the 100th place has been reserved as a tribute to the countless, nameless women who have made selfless sacrifices to help others during the past year. This is but one of many testaments to the idea that the experience of a year — especially 2020 that has tested mankind in unprecedented ways — can be starkly different for women and men., Indeed, the year, 2020, has shown why a separate list for women, such as this one, is warranted. Defined as it was by Covid-19, 2020 amplified pre-existing inequalities — from the economy and the healthcare sector to personal safety and social security — and witnessed women bearing the maximum brunt of challenges within and outside their homes. Some of the adversities are new; but others are persistent ills that have been aggravated by the lockdowns and the resultant isolation necessitated by the contagion. An example of the former would be the entrapment of women at home with abusive family members: the United Nations was forced to describe the exponential rise in cases of domestic violence as a “shadow pandemic” alongside Covid-19. Older, ugly issues raised their heads too. The already-precarious nature of employment for women in India’s informal sector has been rendered even more uncertain; trafficking networks have thrived, profiting off vulnerable girls and women., Mercifully, the list brings some cheer, enumerating the courage and the spirit of women who have fought to overcome such odds. Four Indian women have found themselves in this shining fraternity; each of them has broken barriers and effected change. The oldest among these women is the octogenarian, Bilkis Bano, who earned respect and recognition as an enduring presence in the peaceful, democratic protest against the divisive Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Shaheen Bagh. Ms Bano dismantled a number of stereotypes associated with age and gender. What was also demolished was the myth of the domestic space being ideal for women. When women like Ms Bano cross the threshold of home to protest against a regressive legislation or other forms of more personal discrimination, it exposes the wickedness of the patriarchal design that idealizes domestic responsibilities and the home as a means of silencing women who are exploited in a myriad ways., It is not enough to celebrate this list of experiences that has been curated by the BBC. Care must be taken to ‘liberate’ this archive of women’s battles against entrenched discrimination from the trap of benign recognition; the list should be a signal for action to alleviate suffering that is primitive and enduring. The unequal lives of women need to be examined, disseminated in the public discourse and taken into account for emancipatory policy interventions. This would not only throw light on the long road that lies ahead before gender equality can be achieved, but also inspire innumerable, struggling women who have not had the opportunity to share their woes with the world.\n",

            "Narendra Modi - Joe Biden’s global democracy promotion should not overlook India - Telegraph India$ 28.11.20$The discussion around the new US president’s policy towards human rights concerns in India has been marked by two extreme poles. One is the woozily idealistic idea of an activist Biden administration actively meddling in Indian political affairs. The other is the coldly realist idea that the new administration in the United States of America, guided by material interests, would be as blithely unconcerned with the growing authoritarianism in India as the Trump administration. , In reality, the Biden administration possesses a range of options to gently nudge India towards democracy without risking a diplomatic fall out. A carefully calibrated policy in this regard is not just realistically possible, it would be in America’s own long-term interest. , On the campaign trail, Joe Biden had promised to put strengthening global democracy back at the core of American foreign policy agenda. In an article for Foreign Affairs, Biden vowed to organize a Global Summit for Democracy during his first year in office. He stated that the summit would aim to “bring together the world’s democracies to strengthen our democratic institutions” and “honestly confront nations that are backsliding”., No democracy is backsliding as rapidly, and with as grave consequences, as the world’s largest one. The latest Freedom House report revealed that India had registered the steepest yearly fall in its Freedom Index among 25 large democracies. If India’s democratic institutions keep declining at the present rate, by the end of Biden’s first term, India’s liberal democratic fate may well be sealed.  , Ultimately, the burden of protecting India’s democratic institutions lies with Indian Opposition leaders and Indian citizens. They could, however, do with a helpful external environment. In the current form, Indian institutions pose little substantial check to Narendra Modi: a Parliament that has been reduced to a rubber stamp, a media that has been largely muzzled or co-opted, and a Supreme Court that was recently described by the eminent intellectual, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, as “slipping into judicial barbarism”., A well-thought-out US strategy can help meaningfully constrain Modi’s room for authoritarian manoeuvre without provoking any fractious clashes in public. It would also make Biden’s democratic promotion talk more credible, and not just a convenient cudgel against rivals such as China and Russia. Soft power, after all, depends on credibility. , To understand how, one must try to comprehend Modi’s Jekyll and Hyde persona on the global and domestic stage, respectively, and how that fits into his political calculations. Unlike Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Modi does not embrace the label of ‘illiberal democracy’. Neither does he clash with Western nations to accentuate his nationalist image, unlike Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte or Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Modi, in contrast, presents himself on the international stage as a responsible global statesman. He never tires of quoting Mahatma Gandhi and evangelizing India’s liberal and secular values. In other words, Modi seamlessly presents himself as the embodiment of India’s democracy on the global stage while constantly threatening it at home. , This well-respected global statesman image is crucial to Modi’s domestic appeal. Unlike many other global strongmen, Modi’s craves international and, in particular, Western acceptance and acclaim. This is the reason why he holds enormously hyped and personalized events with Western leaders such as Donald Trump and David Cameron. He invariably refers to global leaders as his friends — “my friend Donald” or “my friend Barack” — and ostentatiously hugs them in public to highlight their mutual affection and admiration. These moves are meant to pique the nationalistic pride of Indians and increase Modi’s domestic stature. , On the flip side, this makes Modi particularly vulnerable to official statements of disapproval from Western governments. For Modi’s well-crafted illusion to work, Western leaders must go with it. It is likely that Modi gamed the silence of an apathetic Trump administration before carrying out certain contentious moves, such as curtailing the autonomy of Kashmir or passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Biden specifically criticized both these actions in a campaign document along with the implementation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam. In fact, the line expressing “disappointment” at the “restrictions on dissent” and “preventing peaceful protests” in Kashmir follows the line condemning “atrocities against Burma’s Rohingya Muslims”., It is thus likely that Modi will closely observe Biden in the first year of his presidency and gauge whether Biden’s concern for human rights and democracy was just uplifting campaign rhetoric or part of a serious agenda. Modi’s judgment of Biden’s credibility on this front will probably be part of the calculations that decide whether he goes ahead with his next high profile moves that erode India’s democracy. , Therefore, it is not necessary for Biden to take an activist stance to act as a moderating influence on Modi. He just needs to show that, unlike Trump, he is serious about human rights protection. No one expects a high-pitched condemnation from a president who would vitally need the support of Modi on a variety of foreign-policy fronts — from containing China, to combating climate change, to strengthening global institutions. Moreover, the need to deepen ties with India on defence and trade would likely be prioritized over human rights, as has been the case with every previous president. Yet, given Modi’s sensitivity over his international image, all Biden needs to do is impress upon Modi that he would be willing to, whether subtly or bluntly, call him out. , Biden possesses many points of leverage. He can follow Obama’s lead in “privately” urging Modi that India should not be divided along religious lines. His addresses to Indian delegations must underline the importance of protecting minorities, and how that forms an important part of the “shared values between the two countries”. The state department, whose human rights reports have catalogued serious human rights abuses by the Indian government in recent years, must not shy away from expressing its concern or disappointment at key moments. Biden can even depute his progressive vice-president, Kamala Harris, to occasionally deliver some honest chastisement to the country from where she traces her roots., The US Congress, which, to its credit, held hearings on the human rights situation in Kashmir last year, must also continue to closely monitor the situation of minorities in India. It can be pushed in this endeavour by the Progressive House Caucus — leaders such as Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib — who hold advancement of human rights as central to their politics. , For decades, US presidents have claimed that the growth of American power is inextricably linked to the global advancement of democracy and liberal values. The reign of Trump, the only notable exception, is over. The sincerity of this conviction, often compromised in practice, will again be put to the test as the democracy representing a sixth of humanity drifts steadily into the grip of authoritarianism. In the coming decades, India will either be seen as a poster boy for ‘illiberal democracy’ or for the survival of liberal democracy in a challenging terrain. It is in America’s own self-interest that the latter vision prevails. Much will depend on whether Biden turns a blind eye as India slips off the democratic guardrails, or prods and coaxes India back towards them., The author is a political columnist and research associate with the Centre for Policy Research, Delhi\n",

            "shashi-tharoor - Shashi Tharoor refers to 'Hindutva movement' as mirror image of 1947 Muslim communalism - Telegraph India$ 31.10.20$Hindutva movement is the \"mirror image\" of the Muslim communalism of 1947 and its triumph would mark the end of the Indian idea, says senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, asserting that Hindutva is a political doctrine, not a religious one., A 'Hindu India' would not be Hindu at all, but a \"Sanghi Hindutva state\", which is a different country altogether, says Tharoor in his new book 'The Battle of Belonging' that was released on Saturday., \"People like me want to preserve the India we love, and not turn our beloved nation into the kind of religious state we were brought up to detest,\" he said., Tharoor also asserted that the Hindutva movement rhetoric echoes the bigotry that India was constructed to reject., In the book published by Aleph Book Company, Tharoor makes a stinging critique of the Hindutva doctrine and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which he says is a challenge to, arguably, the most fundamental aspect of Indianness., Devoting a chapter to the 'Hindu Pakistan' controversy in the book, the former Union minister writes: \"I had inveighed against the ruling party's attempts to create a Hindutva version of Pakistan, since that was not what our freedom movement fought for, nor was it the idea of India enshrined in our Constitution.\", \"This is not just about the minorities, as the BJP would have us believe. Many proud Hindus like myself cherish the inclusive nature of our faith and have no desire to live, as our Pakistani neighbours are forced to, in an intolerant mono-religious state,\" he writes., Tharoor's reported comment last year that the BJP will pave the way for creation of a \"Hindu Pakistan\" had sparked a controversy with the party demanding his apology over the remarks., Hinduism, as Swami Vivekananda asserted, teaches the acceptance of difference as a basic credo, Tharoor said in the book., \"What is bizarre about the media drama over my remarks is that no one who was giving airtime to multiple BJP voices, frothing at the mouth about my words, actually asked them one simple question: 'Is the BJP giving up its dream of a Hindu rashtra?\" Tharoor said., BJP apologists point out that the government has done nothing to amend the Constitution, and others have suggested that the Supreme Court's ruling that secularism is part of the 'basic structure' of the Constitution makes the idea of a 'Hindutva Pakistan' impossible, he said., \"But the fact is that both have only been held at bay by the simple fact that the BJP has not had the numbers required to achieve their goal -- two-thirds of both Houses of Parliament and half the states,\" he said., Their overwhelming victory in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and winning a plurality of seats in the Rajya Sabha in June 2020 has ensured that they finally have all the elements needed to fulfil their \"project\", he said, adding that the nation has been \"warned\"., Tharoor argues in the book that the battle is between two opposing ideas of India or what might be described as ethno-religious nationalism versus civic nationalism., In a sharp criticism of the CAA, Tharoor said it is the first law to question a basic building block of the nation -- that religion is not the determinant of our nationhood and, therefore, of our citizenship., At a time when India's major national priority ought to have been its flailing economy, whose plummeting growth rate had already aroused widespread alarm even before the coronavirus struck, the Modi government plunged the country into an unwanted political crisis of its own making with the CAA, he said., \"With its penchant for shock-and-awe, the government pushed through Parliament legislation that fast-tracks citizenship for people fleeing persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh -- provided they are not Muslim. By excluding members of just one community, the new law is antithetical to India's secular and pluralist traditions,\" writes Tharoor., \"The religious bigotry that partitioned the country with the founding of Pakistan has now been mirrored in pluralist India. As I told my fellow parliamentarians, that was a partition in the Indian soil; this is now a partition in the Indian soul,\" he said., The Hindutva movement is the mirror image of the Muslim communalism of 1947; its rhetoric echoes the bigotry that India was constructed to reject, Tharoor said., Its triumph would mark the end of the Indian idea, the Congress leader added., In the book, Tharoor also delves into the issue of the slogan 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' allegedly becoming an \"acid test of Indian nationalism\" and reiterated his stance that no Indian should be compelled to mouth a phrase that is nationalistic in the eyes of some, but not in his own., Revisiting the 2016 controversy involving Muslim legislator Waris Pathan, who was suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly soon after for refusing to utter the slogan, Tharoor noted that some Muslims say, \"'Tell us to say Jai Hind, Hindustan Zindabad, Jai Bharat, we'll do it -- but do not ask us to say Bharat Mata ki Jai'.\", \"The same Constitution that, in our civic nationalism, gives us the right to freedom of speech, also gives us the freedom of silence. We cannot put words in people's mouths,\" he asserted., Tharoor also criticized the manner in which Article 370 was abrogated on August 5, 2019, saying Modi shocked the nation with an announcement on Kashmir that could well turn out to be the \"political equivalent of demonetization\".\n",

            "Varavara Rao - On the arrests of men and women of conscience - Telegraph India$ 23.10.20$My father was a brilliant metallurgist who worked for the Tatas. We lived in Jamshedpur and would go for long walks. He loved the forests around the city. I remember one evening as we walked, the Tata ‘mountains’ poured out their slag — molten and incandescent — as if the Tatas made sunsets. Then, a few minutes later, the Dalma hills lit up as the tribals burnt an area for jhum cultivation. Both were brilliant sights and my father watched entranced. He then said, almost cryptically, “Both have to survive. Justice is balance between the two.” For my father, Tata’s validity lay in the continuity of the tribe. It was a vision of a different world. , When I heard of the Jesuit Father, Stan Swamy, I sensed here was a man who understood that vision, grasped why the tribes and the tribal way of life had to survive. People talk of the Jesuits practising conversion without realizing that many Jesuits have fought against conversion. What Jesuits like Stan Swamy preached was not to be converted to the fundamentalism of development, a world that destroys the margins. Stan Swamy at 83 represented that world, represented a hope that the tribal world and its imagination may survive. When the government arrested him for conspiracy, one realized that what they were arresting is hope and justice for the tribe as a way of life. It is sad, in fact ridiculous, that Stan Swamy should have been arrested under a tribal chief minister, Hemant Soren, who sat silent at first before the diktats of the Centre. , The sadness of this regime, its mediocrity, comes from arresting men and women of conscience. It is not ideology one objects to but conscience and caring. I sensed this when I got a letter from Kobad Ghandy thanking me for a piece I had written. There was a quiet elegance to the letter, a matter-of-factness about jail. What he mourned was the death of his wife, who was busy as an activist in tribal areas. , At that moment, I was wondering whether the word, Naxal, should be used to refer to people battling for justice. They seem more to be conscientious objectors fightingfor a different dream with the weapon of courage rather than destruction. The regime’s indifference to such idealism seemed perplexing. One has to ask if the best of our society, from Stan to Kobad, are in jail, how does one define the civic and the social? It looks more like an honour list than a roster of criminals. These people do not speak the rabid logic of Kanu Sanyal or Jangal Santhal. They talk of justice, suffering, without reifying revolution and they suffer quietly in jail without a murmur. Ghandy could have been my professor at the Delhi School of Economics. I wish a writer like Mahasweta Devi were around. She had an uncanny sense of hypocrisy, of calling the bluff of a regime like the current one. , As the regime grows in power, one senses a Stalinism against the tribe. Kobad and Mahashweta were witnesses to such tyranny. Watching him speak one day, I realized the wisdom of a leading dissenter. He told me the only way one can be nationalist in the Modi-era is to be anti-national. It is anti-national to defend the life of a tribe, to protect craft as a way of thinking, to define caring as the essence of citizenship. Whenever the question of caring is raised in this context, people cite Mother Teresa. They accuse her of conversion. I remember when an official wanted to harass her, Jyoti Basu slammed him, saying no one can empathize with suffering and justice the way she can. Both Marxist and missionary understood caring was a cosmopolitanism that went beyond Marx and Christianity. Caring was an act of love, of compassion. , In this sense, Sudha Bharadwaj cared, cared for the people she fought for. It is a strange regime that sentences her for caring. But then one has to realize that it is only government that does not care that can create the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and see Covid-19 as an Olympiad of death. In any real democratic country, we would be telling stories of Stan, Sudha and Kobad. Instead we harass them, telling an aspirational, mobile generation that caring is criminal. Even Kafka could not have produced the turn of phrase. , Regimes for the past few decades have always produced the archetype of the Naxal they love to hate. In India, it is the poet, Varavara Rao. Rao carries his poetry and politics lightly. I remember the first time I met him. It was in Bhopal after the gas tragedy of 1984. He spoke of justice. Standing around him were tribals who carried shields with a strange tribal god. I discovered it was Stalin. Rao smiled, hinting that maybe the tribals understood and tamed the demonic in Stalin better than we did. Rao has been at every demonstration for justice. He cares that his poetry creates an oral language of caring. He is virtually saying my orality is my morality. My protest is my ritual of citizenship. It has an eloquence and an originality. Today, Rao is ill and the regime takes pride in arresting him because he cares too much. The word, humanitarian, or justice, does not seem to apply when we discuss such men. All of them have added a sense of civilization to their struggles. It is a strange society that criminalizes caring and justice. , But present politics is more than a condemnation of virtues. Majoritarian democracy hates dissent because dissent celebrates the poetics and politics of difference. The arrest of Hany Babu from Delhi University exposes this. Dissenters and dissenting imaginations may be more committed to their institutions and see institution-building beyond law-and-order issues. As a wag put it, soon social service will be suspect; it will be conducted in jails. Dissent needs to be understood in the wider context of knowledge and democracy as a difference that sustains. A majoritarian regime has little sense of the university and its pluralism. As an institution, the university has been the first major casualty of a repressive and mediocre regime. , In fact, one has to read a sense of plurality and debate into these issues. One does not have to agree with everything that is said, but one must understand the dynamics of dissent in keeping us plural and free. The sadness is ideology has completely destroyed both protest and scholarship. The merging of internal and external security has made dissent the first target of a securitarian regime. , Two modes of dissent have suffered from this onslaught. The concerns for environment and for human rights. Both these issues have converged around the tribe as a way of life and thought. The fate of the tribe, the loosening of forest laws, all gets swept under the table of ‘urban Naxal’. The word, Naxal, threatens the tribal way of life. One needs to deconstruct it and understand the plural styles of Marxism, from Rosa Luxemburg to Teodor Shanin. We need a rethinking of scholarship here. , The arrest of Stan Swamy and others raises these issues. It is time citizens and academics see these dissenters and scholars as arguments for democracy and sustain them. Politics without ethics is finally empty., The author is an academic associated with Compost Heap, a network pursuing alternative imaginations\n",

The memorandum demanded the immediate release of Stan Swamy and all political prisoners. It also called for the “closure of the  Bhima-Koregaon case and revocation of false cases related to Delhi riots filed against CAA-NRC activists, and repealing of sections 124A (sedition) &amp; 499 (criminal defamation) of the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Preventions) Act (UAPA) and National Security Act (NSA) against all of them.”, On Friday, several members of the Catholic Church formed a 5km-long human chain seeking the release of Swamy, who was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on October 8 in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence in Pune in 2017. The NIA has accused Swamy of having links with CPI (Maoists)., Praful Linda of Adivasi Adhikar Manch said, “Swamy is in prison amid inhuman conditions without having access to basic rights.” Sanjay Pandey, the district Congress secretary, added, “Swamy’s arrest is part of the Union government’s strategy to increase its loot of Jharkhand’s natural resources. He has been a leading voice for the oppressed which earned him the Centre’s ire.”, Former chairperson of the state women’s commission and JMM member Mahua Manjhi condemned Swamy’s arrest. “NIA could have interrogated him at his residence in Bagaicha. What was the need to keep him behind bars?” she said., CPI(ML) MLA from Bagodar Vinod Singh spoke of “growing attacks” against human rights activists, intellectuals and others who speak up for people’s rights. “On the lines of Bhima Koregaon, the government is now accusing political and student leaders opposing CAA-NRC of inciting the riots in Delhi,” he said, appealing to all Opposition parties to join hands to demand the release of Swamy and others in the Bhima Koregaon case.  , Ratan Tirkey, a former member of the state’s Tribal Advisory Council, said that until the Modi government came to power, no political leader stooped so low as to accuse Swamy with fake charges. “The BJP government has created an atmosphere of fear, but there is an uprising happening against it everywhere now.”\n",

The draft NRC had excluded over 40 lakh applicants., “A software application for submission of the reviewed results of such persons along with mechanism for uploading of the scanned speaking order (freshly written) will be rolled out shortly,” the order said., NRC sources said no deadline has been set but they expect the process to be completed within a month. The move has been necessitated because ineligible persons are a “threat” to national security., The sources also did not reveal the estimated numbers on whom the axe will fall but NGO Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the case which led to the NRC update being monitored by the Supreme Court, said the “number would be around 80 lakh”, a figure they have quoted in an affidavit filed last year for 100 per cent re-verification of the updated NRC.   , The state NRC office has written to the deputy commissioners and the DRCR “regarding reports received for change in result of persons of final NRC” thrice this year — in January, February and March, when the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus was imposed., The NRC communiqué said the Local Registrar of Citizen Registration (LRCR) “may at any time before the final publication of the NRC in the State of Assam may cause or direct to cause verification of names of such persons considered necessary” of the Schedule of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens &amp; Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003., The verification would mandatorily require the correct identity of the person so that no ambiguity arises in future in identification of the person concerned, according to the order of the NRC coordinator. It has been marked to the chief secretary and the RGI., However, the order has evoked mixed reactions., Senior Supreme Court advocate and anti-influx activist Upamanyu Hazarika told The Telegraph that the timing of this order was surprising., “It’s been over two years since the publication of the draft NRC but it took them so long to discover these cases. Discrepancies and inclusion of a large number of foreigners in the NRC has been a primary public concern in Assam and is viewed as a failure of the present government as their leadership has been more concerned with exclusion of Hindu Bangladeshis rather than inclusion of Muslim infiltrators,” he said., With the Assembly elections coming up, they want to assuage indigenous sentiments as it’s this vote which put them in power, Hazarika said. , Assam goes to polls in April-May next year., APW’s Aabhijeet Sharma, however, welcomed the order. “The final NRC needs to be free of illegal foreigners. We have urged the Supreme Court for 100 per cent re-verification,” he said., The population of Assam is around 3.2 crore., The state government had told the Assembly in August this year that it remained “strongly in favour” of re-verification of 20 per cent names included in the updated NRC from districts bordering Bangladesh and 10 per cent in the remaining districts., Those applicants excluded from the updated NRC are yet to be assigned the reasons for their exclusion so that they can challenge their cases in the foreigners tribunals.\n",

Lokur to probe the Delhi riots, in the light of “extensive critical commentary” of the investigations by Delhi police., Besides Justice Lokur, others in the committee include Justices A.P. Shah, former chief justice of the Madras and Delhi high courts and former chairman of the Law Commission of India; Justice R.S. Sodhi, former judge of Delhi High Court; Justice Anjana Prakash, former judge of Patna High Court; former Union home secretary G.K. Pillai and Meeran Chadha Borwankar, who retired as director-general, Bureau of Police Research and Development., All of them are part of the Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG), a collective that has spoken out against the harassment of anti-CAA activists on the pretext of investigation into the riots., A member of the panel told The Telegraph: “We cannot force anyone to testify, but notices will be issued to ask people to submit affidavits. We will also ask the authorities to explain what they are doing. We will examine information such as FIRs and chargesheets which are in the public domain.”, The source added: “The objective is to bring correct facts in front of the public. It may not be admissible in a court of law… We will conduct the proceedings on the lines a commission of inquiry follows.”, In 2018, Justice Lokur had addressed a news conference along with fellow apex court judges Ranjan Gogoi, Kurian Joseph and J. Chelameswar, to speak out against the functioning of then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. Pillai had criticised the previous Congress-led government for giving two affidavits on the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, one of which omitted to mention that those killed were members of the Lashkar-e-Toiba., The collective said in a statement: “Considering the horrific nature of the riots in North-East Delhi in February 2020, the scale of violence, the loss of lives and the resulting communal divide between communities, we felt that an expert body should carry out a thorough examination of what transpired before, during and after the riots. This has become even more necessary as the investigation carried out into the riots by the Delhi police has evoked extensive critical commentary in recent times. We therefore conclude that a Committee with credible reputations in the higher judiciary, the civil service and the police would be best suited to contribute to an objective and fair understanding of the riots and their aftermath.”, The terms of reference, stated by the group, are: “1. To inquire into the events that transpired before and during the riots, including the response of the state machinery in dealing with the violence, restoring law and order, and related matters; 2. To analyse and assess the response of the police in investigating the riots; 3. To examine the role of the mainstream and social media in spreading information, both genuine and fake, before, during and after the riots, and its impact on events, and 4. To assess the civic administration’s efforts at providing relief and extending reparations to the victims of riots.”, In the recent past, the police had ignored requests for information from a Delhi Minority Commission probe that accused BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, of inciting the riots in February that killed 53 people., No “commission of inquiry” has been instituted for the riots so far. In Delhi, only the Centre has the powers to set up such a commission before whom witnesses can be compelled to depose.\n",

            "refugee - Amidst persisting apprehensions over NRC, Bengali Dalit writer Jatin Bala on a refugee childhood - Telegraph India$ 11.10.20$Bachao, bachao... thus begins Bengali Dalit writer Jatin Bala’s autobiography Shikor Chhera Jibon or My Uprooted Life. The first volume of the book is now being translated into English — a Sahitya Akademi initiative. When I meet Bala at his home in the South 24-Parganas, the octogenarian tells me, “I was only five years old when we had to run away from our village in East Pakistan. The bloody scenes are etched in my mind as if carved on a soft rock.”, Bala, a retired government officer, lives in a spartan apartment, a loner’s den. Except for the bellowing of a passing local train — the housing complex is close to the Sonarpur railway crossing — the place is all peace and quiet. He continues, “I am a refugee. I was a victim of the riots of 1954 [that had to do with the ethnic cleansing of Bengali Hindus from East Pakistan].”, Bala was born in 1949 in Jessore, now in Bangladesh. There was communal tension everywhere. He lost his mother when he was a little over a year old and his father died when he was barely four. He was brought up by his eldest brother, who was older to him by 25 years., Bala narrates how his father had to leave their family home and shift to another village as he was suspected to be an Indian spy because of his eldest brother’s connection with the extremist Rajat Biswas, a close associate of the freedom fighter Bagha Jatin. Bala’s father died soon after., Bala recalls an evening sometime in 1953-54, when their village was attacked and houses were set ablaze. He, his siblings and his paternal aunt, along with many others in the village, fled and hid amongst the thickets beyond. He says, “The next morning we reached a Hindu-majority village called Boro Bondortala.”, Days later, they secured the requisite permits and left for the Benapole border. They walked over 37 kilometres before they could reach there. Says Bala, “And as we walked, more people from other villages kept streaming in and joining the steady flow. We were all beggars — women carried small bundles with bare essentials, men and children were barebodied, barefoot. We had left behind everything... When we reached the Benapole border, it took hours to get the border pass.”, The siblings finally crossed the border, reached Petrapole on the Indian side, and from there they walked all the way to the Bongaon railway station in West Bengal. From there they were eventually taken to Sealdah., Sealdah was not the family’s ultimate destination,  nor did it spell an end to their suffering. Rather, it was the beginning of another long and arduous journey. Says Bala, “At the Bongaon station, we found thousands and thousands like us — homeless, uprooted. There was dearth of food and water. In fact, there was no place to sit and rest. Volunteers were handing out chire, muri, chhatu. I yearned for a morsel of rice.”, The five-year-old Bala had possibly witnessed more than his brain could process. Even as he recounts his memories, he makes loopy gestures with his hands as if to show the images still jangling inside his head. He says, “I saw people die. Many had died en route, before reaching India. We left the dead bodies on the roads and kept walking. People died after reaching Bongaon and Sealdah. Babies died of hunger, women died of hunger. For days we went without taking a bath. Our bodies stank.”, The streets adjoining Sealdah station — College Street and Harrison Road (now known as Mahatma Gandhi Road) — seemed like an ongoing exhibition of distress. On both sides of the road people had set up rag-tag brick ovens and were cooking rice in earthen pots. Bala remembers helping his brother cook for the whole family. But before he could partake of the much-awaited morsel, one of his brothers was asked to leave for the Bhandarhati Workside Camp in Hooghly. Three camps had been put up there for the refugees — the Kunti Transit Camp, the Balagarh Camp and the one at Bhandarhati., The family split at Sealdah station. Says Bala, “Mejda [the second brother] was sent away and the rest of us were loaded onto trucks and sent to Kunti.” Someone packed the rice in a gamchha to be eaten later., At Kunti, there were 500-600 tents. The camp was dirty and unkempt. Says Bala, “Many children died from the strain and the filth. Men who stayed in the camps were sometimes murdered by the locals as they regarded us as apod or extraneous menace who had come to take away their share of land, work, food... The cash dole given by the government was too paltry to survive on and we were not allowed to leave the camp and go out in search for jobs.”, Here Bala worked as a child labour and was often physically abused. “One day, when I fell down while carrying a bundle of straw on my head, I resolved I would study and get myself an education,” he says., It was during his time at the Kunti camp that Bala started attending school. In the meantime, his brother kept approaching the authorities to let them shift to the Bhandarhati camp so that they could be united with the other brother. After two-and-a-half years they shifted to Bhandarhati. Says Bala, “One of the inspectors had learnt that my elder brother was a freedom fighter.”, The Bhandarhati camp was a work site; a dam was being constructed at the time. It was a low-lying area infested with snakes and mosquitoes. Bala recalls, “It was an extremely unhealthy place to live in — children died of malaria and tuberculosis.” The authorities put the refugees to work at the construction site. But when the work was over, the Government of India decided to demolish the camp. “We protested and even went on hunger strike,” says Bala. But this protest did more harm than good. “Police bulldozed the camps; lathicharged indiscriminately, dumped us into trucks like animals and we were again transferred to another camp — the one at Balagarh,” he says., Bala’s education was interrupted., The family’s fortunes now split. The eldest brother managed to secure a loan and a plot of land, where he built a house. But Bala’s Mejda stayed on in the Balagarh camp and Bala with him. He says, “One day the government decided to stop giving us cash dole. I even stopped receiving the book grant I had received so far. There was no money, no food; for two days I survived on taal gola (the pulp of the palm fruit mixed in water).”, Bala came out of the camp and into a regular life when he was in his teens. The period between then and now he narrates with a single word — “Ei” — and a sweep of his hands. He stares out of the window and says, “Now, when the BJP government is repeatedly talking about NRC (National Register for Citizens), about identifying the Muslims who came to India after Partition, of sending them away, I fear for their plight, for their life. Once again refugee camps will come up, once again people will be dumped into those inhuman confinements. Once again people will be rendered powerless, abandoned — sans homes, sans land, sans a country to call their own.”\n",

            "mahatma-gandhi - Ethical dispossession: Compassion versus sympathy - Telegraph India$ 11.10.20$In the history of politico-ethical thought in India, the concept of compassion/daya was not always pegged to the idea of identification — the spectator of suffering ‘becoming one’ with the sufferer. In fact, Mohandas Gandhi’s notion of dayadharma (religion of compassion), as the historian, Ajay Skaria, calls it, has been one of the best instances of the grounding of the idea of compassion on a crucial concept of non-identification. In his formidable book, Radical Equality: Ambedkar, Gandhi, and the Risk of Democracy, the historian, Aishwary Kumar, has argued that for Gandhi, touching/approaching the harijan/untouchable within the Indian caste axis required a certain idea of ‘economy’, ‘distance’ or the ‘phenomenology of measure’. To formulate it in different terms, it was based on the analytic of a necessary non-identification of the brahmin with the shudra. To approach this ‘different’, ‘unequal’ Other — the harijan, who was the ‘most violated’ — demanded a fortitude that, Kumar tells us, was often, counter-intuitively enough, founded upon converting the act of ‘discrimination’ itself into a political ideal., Despite Kumar’s critique of Gandhi for contending that unlike the brahmin who could ‘become harijan’, the harijan could never emulate/‘become’ the brahmin, what is crucial to note is that even on an issue like untouchability where Gandhi is arguably at his paternalistic best, the idea of compassion towards this violated harijan was based precisely on an ethic of ‘distance’ between the brahmin and the harijan, as Kumar calls it, and not on identification/sameness. It involved an admission that the ‘upper’ caste can never be completely ‘one’ with the harijan, thereby involving a necessary unknowability/unintelligibility or, what Gandhi called, maryada, an ‘ethics of limit’ (Kumar), and what Skaria, in his crucial book on Gandhi, identifies as an ethic of ‘finitude’ that dwells at the very heart of — and thereby haunts — liberal postulations on freedom. The implication here is that ‘becoming harijan’ (just like ‘becoming woman’) for Gandhi was about two things: first, acknowledging that the ‘truth’ (satya) of the divinity of the harijan’s suffering cannot be accessed unless the one who is aiming at gaining access to this suffering (the non-harijan) sacrifices; second, this act of sacrifice is fundamentally predicated upon acknowledging that gaining access to/‘knowing’ the ‘truth-force’ of the harijan’s divine suffering cannot be based on complete identification of the non-harijan with the harijan. It must involve, what Skaria calls and Kumar explains to be, a ‘radically conservative’ process of both the brahmin and the harijan being ‘dispossessed’ from their own selves. This radically non-sovereign gesture of ‘becoming harijan’ for Gandhi was the fulcrum of the anti-colonial political struggle., It will be a mistake to think that the act of grounding this ‘force of compassion’ (as Kumar calls it) on non-identification was the sole prerogative of Indic traditions. In Plato’s text, Alcibiades — on political governance in early Greek society — the notion of ‘Self-Care’/‘Care of the Self’ shared a remarkably similar apparatus of ideas with the aforementioned legacy of grounding compassion on non-identification. ‘Self-Care’, as Michel Foucault has demonstrated, was predominantly about an unselfconscious acknowledgement that self-knowledge or wisdom (sôphrosunê) was necessary for governing the individuals in the city-state in pre-Christian Athens. This was, in turn, only possible by not ‘learning’ about the ‘truth’ of the other’s suffering but, rather, through looking at the ‘divine’ soul of the other. As Socrates explained, this was structurally similar to how in order to see/visualize oneself, one would generally look at the ‘best part’ of the eye (the pupil) of the other person. In the process (Foucault under-emphasizes this), Plato acknowledged the necessary incompleteness of the self of the one who wishes to govern., However, in the mainstream liberal tradition that eventually helped fortify the edifice of colonial conquest and empire, compassion had a completely heterogeneous meaning. This heterogeneity is best exemplified in one of the founding moments of Western modernity — via Adam Smith’s iconic text, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, through the notion of an apparently homologous term, ‘sympathy’. Sympathy, unlike compassion, is predominantly based on the ‘personal identification’ of the spectator of suffering with the sufferer, victim or the object of governance. The historian, Dipesh Chakrabarty, had pointed out (albeit without emphasizing the aforementioned Gandhian ethic of necessary non-identification/unknowability) that for Smith, the only way through which we can know what other sufferers might be feeling is by ‘imagining’ what we ‘ourselves’ might have felt in a similar situation. Here, the spectator imagines that he himself is enduring ‘similar torments’ and becomes, to a certain extent, the ‘same person’ as the sufferer. For Smith, as Chakrabarty further suggested, there are almost always certain principles in the very nature of an individual that ‘interest him’ in the happiness of others and render their ‘good fortune’ necessary to him. On the contrary, compassion, unlike sympathy, is not merely made to depend on the intelligibility of suffering based on self-identification., Placing this brief conceptual history in the context of the contemporary disparagement of the evocation of religious symbols by Muslims during the anti-CAA protests that India recently witnessed and drawing from an interrogation that Partha Chatterjee, in tracing a genealogy of the present cosmopolitan order, has engaged in, the question one needs to ask is this: is the Indian State apparatus rejecting the anti-colonial, Gandhian legacy of compassion and, instead, appealing to the liberal-ideological and imperialist (Smithian) impulse of sympathy in its exercise of political power? The political scientist, Rahul Rao, has recently pointed out how the evocation of the poem, “Hum Dekhenge”, by Faiz Ahmed Faiz, bearing the lines, “Sab taj uchhale jayenge/Sab takht girae jayenge/ Bas naam rahega Allah ka,” was met with visceral disdain from the liberal-secularizing intelligentsia at IIT Kanpur for supposedly being incommensurable with the identity of a ‘tolerant’ nation. Similarly, when the Muslim woman, Hadiya, in one of her testimonies, defined ‘liberty’ as the habitual recitation of a potentially non-anthropomorphic practice like namaz, that too was met with severe scorn from the judiciary. In a speech delivered in 2012, Narendra Modi had, in fact, suggested, “Drown all your gods in water. The Swami [referring to Vivekananda] left his gods too for a higher aim. Let your god be Mahabharti [the Hindu term for the Indian nation state] now.” These instances of, what Étienne Balibar calls, the ‘careful replacement’ of religious identities with national ones have only multiplied in recent times., What modes of political subjectivity do the State apparatus need to cultivate if it is to, once again, steer the idea of compassion towards the object of governance on non-identification and, thereby, appeal to the Gandhian (Platonic) idiom of compassion? The political future of Indian democracy hinges on whether it pegs itself to the anti-colonial, nationalist legacy of compassion or the liberal-imperialist legacy of sympathy., sbaner03@mail.bbk.ac.uk\n",

            "supreme-court-of-india - Letters to the Editor -- October 11, 2020: Better safe than sorry - Telegraph India$ 11.10.20$Sir — Doctors have warned the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, that Durga Puja celebrations could cause a massive surge in Covid-19 cases. In a year when the world has been turned topsy-turvy by the pandemic, one must ask if public celebrations are really unavoidable. What is worse, like each year, there are awards for best Pujas and so on. This will make organizers compete to make creative pandals, which people will then flock to. Surely, the only award this year should be for the pandal that ensures that people can enjoy the Pujas safely?, Tiyasha MukherjeeCalcutta, Sir — While the Supreme Court accepted the right to peacefully protest against a legislation, it also made it absolutely clear that protests in public places for an indefinite period of time are unacceptable. A three-judge bench held that democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone. The court also said that protests must not block a public way and cause inconvenience to commuters. , The order came in response to a petition regarding the Shaheen Bagh protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. A significant aspect of democracy is that citizens have the right to freely express their views, mobilize and protest. On the other hand, it is true that they are not entitled to infringe on the rights of fellow citizens. While the Supreme Court order will safeguard the rights of commuters, it will do so at the cost of those protesting against a divisive, unlawful Act. Restrictions on protesting, especially for groups that have no other way of expressing themselves publicly, will jeopardize the right to freedom of expression. While it is true that the protests may have caused some inconvenience to people, the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of expression are inviolable in a democracy. It is unjust to specify where public assemblies must occur in a democracy. Given that political and social participation through public demonstration is critical to the consolidation of democracy, the judiciary and the governments are expected to accord due weightage to this practice., Venu G.S.Kollam, Kerala, Sir — When a Supreme Court bench said, “Public places cannot be occupied indefinitely. Dissent and democracy go hand in hand but protests must be carried out in designated area... Such kind of occupation of public place for protests is not acceptable,” it made a truly sensible observation. Although those sitting in protest at Shaheen Bagh have returned home in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the verdict shows the path for future protests. In India, protests like the one in Shaheen Bagh have been taking place for long — remember Anna Hazare’s protest? But Shaheen Bagh was different — nothing could scare the protesters away from the place, not shots fired, not petrol bombs hurled at the site. Shaheen Bagh has shown the world the meaning of a peaceful protest. If this is done at designated places, then the rights of others will not be infringed upon either., Bidyut Kumar ChatterjeeFaridabad, Sir — The Supreme Court has said that protests can and should take place only at designated spots in the city. But one is forced to ask if this will ever achieve the desired results. People protest in their own way but unless others are made to stop in their tracks do they take notice? Is a minor public inconvenience of greater concern than a divisive bill that seeks to turn thousands of rightful Indians aliens in their own country? Moreover, is not restricting the rights of some citizens to express themselves in a location of their choice an infringement on their rights?, While the Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions, the primary issue — that of the constitutionality of an Act that singles out one community and excludes it from the benevolence and amnesty of the State — remains unaddressed. The pandemic did a good job of sweeping that issue under the carpet. In such a situation, a protest that is visible and makes people pause and think is more important than ever., Rohan SenguptaCalcutta\n",

Our constitutional scheme comes with the right to protest and express dissent, but with an obligation towards certain duties,” the apex court said., It said Article 19 gave citizens the right to speak freely and assemble peacefully “and protest against the actions or inactions of the State”., “The same must be respected and encouraged by the State, for the strength of a democracy such as ours lies in the same. (However) these rights are subject to reasonable restrictions, which… pertain to the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India and public order, and to the regulation by the concerned police authorities in this regard,” the court said., It cited its 2018 judgment in Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan vs Union of India that said each fundamental right must be balanced with every other contrasting right., The top court frowned on Delhi High Court’s failure to pass suitable orders when the petitioners had initially approached it, seeking the protesters’ removal. The high court had left the matter to the police’s discretion., “The high court should have monitored the matter rather than disposing of the writ petition and creating a fluid situation,” the apex court said., It referred to the Covid-19 pandemic as the “hand of God” that had caused the protest to end. “The hand of God subsequently intervened and overtook the situation as not only our country, but also the world grappled with the coronavirus pandemic,” it said., “Thus, really speaking, the reliefs in the present proceedings have worked themselves out.”\n",

Today, we can see that there are no answers to the biggest current questions on education, employment and peace. Protest was and is the last resort, and while sit-ins on roads are not new, it seems that only one community is the target of arrests and defamation,” she told The Telegraph., Ritu Kaushik, secretary of the Delhi unit of All India Mahila Sanskritik Sanghatan — the women’s wing of SUCI (Communist) — said  the verdict doesn’t surprise her. Kaushik often handled the mic on the Shaheen Bagh stage and had stuck it out until police cleared the area in March. “Neither are protests, even sit-ins, on roads a new thing, nor is the court’s response.”, “Even during the Emergency, the point of view of the court gradually changed in the face of public protests. Today also, we continue to struggle in defence of the Constitution…. and will continue to do so by all means possible to resist the CAA and related laws,” she added., Mohammed Asif, who used to run the Fatima Sheikh-Savitri Phule Library under a bus stop near the protest site, said: “It was never indefinite. The protest was merely to be staged until the CAA was repealed. The question of moving to some other place like Jantar Mantar was debated when the interlocutors had visited. There are restrictions on the number of people and the timing of protests in Jantar Mantar.  There is no other place or park to protest in Shaheen Bagh or perhaps any other Muslim majority area in Delhi. The question people asked interlocutors was whether the press will cover us and the government even attempt to engage with us if our stir caused absolutely no inconvenience to anyone.”\n",

            "bharatiya-janata-party - Artistes united by CAA, divided by politics - Telegraph India$ 27.08.20$The movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act had united the artistes of Assam last year but the upcoming Assembly polls has divided the fraternity in two halves, which seems to be evident from the two induction functions held by the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress here on Tuesday., While 39 artistes joined the Congress, which is opposed to the CAA, 30 others embraced the BJP, whose government at the Centre brought the law into force. Indications are that more such inductions will be effected by both parties in the run-up to the polls next year. BJP had inducted a few more artistes last week., Most of those who joined either the BJP or the Congress were an integral part of the anti-CAA movement in the state. Now they will be taking diametrically opposing positions on the CAA which is likely to be the main issue in the state polls., Leading the artistes to the Opposition camp were popular singer Babu Baruah and lyricist Ajoy Phukan as this group from the entertainment industry is convinced that the Congress was consistent in its stand against the CAA, according to Imdad Hussain, AICC member and Assam Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson., The artistes were inducted in the Congress by PCC president Ripun Bora., “They believe in the party’s secular and inclusive ideology. They were also convinced that only the Congress can fight the legislation in Parliament. More artistes will join the party and they will take the Congress’s anti-CAA and other pro-people messages to the people before the Assembly polls next year,” Hussain told The Telegraph., The Citizenship Amendment Act, which provides citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan entering the country till December 2014, came into effect on January 10 this year., Those opposed to the CAA assert that it is a threat to Assam’s identity and culture while those in its favour dismiss the contention. Protests are still being held across the Brahmaputra Valley even now., Besides Bora, several senior leaders including AICC joint secretary Sanjay Choudhary, Sarat Borkotoky and Bhumidhar Barman were present during the induction function, the highlight of which was the launch was a catchy song by Babu, CAA nemanu (We won’t accept CAA)., At around the same time, 30 artistes, comprising popular singer Simanta Shekhar and flautist Dipak Sarma, joined the BJP., They were welcomed by state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, who said the BJP has already scaled up the number of seats it would win — from 84 in 2016 to 100 in the 2021 Assembly polls. Assam has 126 seats., Shekhar, who had composed the BJP’s popular campaign song Akou ebaar Modi sarkar (Once more, Modi government) for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and was also a leading face of the anti-CAA protests, said the BJP will form the government once again., State BJP chief spokesperson Rupam Goswami said the artistes  joined the ruling party because they have seen that “lakhs and lakhs of illegal migrants” have not entered Assam because of the legislation as was claimed by the anti-CAA brigade., “Moreover, they have faith in the BJP, our Prime Minister and our chief minister (Sarbananda Sonowal) and the development work they are doing,” Goswami said, adding the artistes met the chief minister after the induction function., Though both the Congress and BJP were happy with the developments ahead of the polls, social media and TV debates were mostly critical of the artistes, most questioning their conduct., A panellist said there was nothing wrong in them joining any party but they should desist from playing with the emotions of the common people who believe in what they see and hear. Others said that the upcoming polls have “unmasked” the artistes and their political preferences., The CAA has remained an emotive issue in Assam since 2018., There was lot of criticism when popular singer Zubeen Garg, the leading face of the anti-CAA movement in Assam, when he was earlier this month asked to become the brand ambassador of the state agriculture department. He has not yet accepted the offer but has been keeping a low profile since. Popular actor Jatin Bora, who had resigned from the BJP during the anti-CAA movement, and rejoined the party recently was criticised and trolled for “letting the people down”., Paresh Malakar, general secretary, Axom Nagarik Samaj, said the developments would not make any impact on politics at the grassroots.\n",

They underlined that the editing process had gone on for three months and said they were anguished at being junked without a formal intimation., “This is breach of contract, unethical and unprofessional conduct. This will invite civil and criminal liability and you will be liable to pay damages to the authors for damaging their reputation, disowning them publicly, causing mental agony to not only the authors but to millions of people who believed in you, who wanted to order the book…. Bloomsbury may we tell you that Brown Lives matter and Brown women matter too,” the email said., “Can we take this liberty to request you to at least inform us officially through email that you have withdrawn/ gone back on the contract, terminated the contract with us, are no longer our publisher?”, Bloomsbury, known for publishing the Harry Potter series, has lately come out with several books that glorify BJP leaders and promote the party’s worldview., This newspaper is yet to receive a reply to a request for a response to the email from Kumar and his company., In a statement on Saturday, Bloomsbury India had said: “In view of very recent events including a virtual pre-publication launch organised without our knowledge by the authors, with participation by parties of whom the publishers would not have approved, we have decided to withdraw publication of the book.”, In their email, the authors said: “You called us on phone and informed us that you are withdrawing as a publisher from the aforesaid book due to pressure from Bloomsbury UK which in turn was pressurised by the social media campaign etc…. You Bloomsbury finalised the draft of the aforesaid book. Authors and you the publisher mutually suggested many changes and all were incorporated in the final draft which the authors finalised and as a publisher you approved.”, They added: “You Bloomsbury went ahead with the publications, published the books, and gave us 100 hard copies…. The e-card of the book launch was put in public domain. You had full knowledge of this book launch and the guest list. You never objected orally or in writing regarding the guest list or the launch event.”, The authors gave Kumar until 4pm on Sunday to reply.

Agnihotri has called for a boycott of historian William Dalrymple, who too has been published by Bloomsbury, for allegedly asking the company to drop the book on the riots., Amid the debate on the freedom of expression that Bloomsbury’s withdrawal of the book has triggered, a post by theatre director and publisher Sudhanva Deshpande is being shared by many as a justification for the call to deny the book the legitimacy offered by a well-known publisher., Deshpande, managing editor of the CPM-backed Leftword Books, wrote on Facebook on Saturday, before Bloomsbury withdrew the book: “Am I calling for the book to be banned? No. I’m asking Bloomsbury, as a leading publisher, to ask itself what editorial protocols permit such a book to be published in such a short time?, “Are you as publisher not responsible for at least elementary fact checking? Are you as publisher not culpable in playing a part in the architecture of terror being created and deployed by the State and non-State actors to punish the victims of violence, and those who stand up for them?”, Deshpande added: “Make no mistake about it. This book has nothing to do with the pursuit of knowledge, in which differences of opinion and interpretation are not just desirable, but essential. This book is part of a multi-pronged attack on India’s secular fabric, on the idea of natural justice, on ethics, on rationality, on humanity, and, because we are talking in a publishing context, on knowledge itself.

Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said., The police had been caught on camera brutally assaulting youngsters at Jamia to quell the protests against the Centre’s new citizenship regime, with some videos showing cops hitting unarmed boys with batons inside a library., The court’s observations were in response to the contention of additional solicitor-general Aman Lekhi that the rights panel had found that there had been a law-and-order situation at Jamia and so police entry into the campus was legitimate., The law officer pointed out that the report had only mentioned that there were individual instances of police excesses and that it did not say that the action as a whole was unwarranted., Lekhi added that the commission had also left it to the police, not any outside agency, to inquire into the individual instances of transgression by its officers., To this, the bench remarked: “That is fine. But it (report) cannot be read as a clean chit being given to anyone either.”, The high court was hearing a batch of petitions that have alleged that the police and paramilitary forces had used ruthless and excessive force on students at the university., The pleas have sought the formation of a special investigation team or a commission of inquiry to look into the violence at Jamia last December during the students’ protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)., Opposing the petitioners’ allegations, Lekhi argued that while they claim that the police action was unwarranted, the NHRC report does not say so. He said that the police action as a whole was “not disproportionate” to the violence on the campus and only in some isolated instances had disproportionate force been used., However, inquiry into these isolated instances have been left to the police by the NHRC and this indicates that the agency can be trusted, contrary to what the petitioners are claiming, Lekhi argued., He said that while the petitioners had claimed that the protests were peaceful, the NHRC report refers to it as “violent”. PTI, The law officer iterated his argument during the previous hearing on August 14 that the police had entered the university to restore order, which had been disrupted by incidents of arson and destruction of public property during the students’ protests., Lekhi will continue his arguments on August 28. \n",

            "ram-nath-kovind - Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha writes to the president on academic witchhunt - Telegraph India$ 22.08.20$Rajya Sabha MP and Delhi University professor Manoj Jha has written to President Ram Nath Kovind demanding “the government stop the farcical media trial” of Apoorvanand Jha, his colleague who teaches Hindi at the same varsity., Jha had previously spoken out against alleged police atrocities on those protesting against the new citizenship matrix and the force’s purported complicity in the February communal riots that killed 53 people. He wrote to the President on Thursday after two news channels aired purported excerpts of confessions by two youths in police custody, accused of instigating the riots., News channels, including one that described Apoorvanand as “Dilli dangon ka professor” (the professor of Delhi riots), cited unnamed police sources to say that 28-year-old Gulfisha Fatima had confessed that Apoorvanand was the main instigator of the riots., Fatima has been booked in four FIRs on the charges of murder and Arms Act violations, and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)., Earlier this month, another channel had reported that Jamia Millia Islamia student Meeran Haider — a local leader of the youth wing of Jha’s party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, who too has been booked under the UAPA— had confessed that the riots had been planned on the campus with funding from the Popular Front of India, a volunteer group that focuses on Muslims and Dalits and holds RSS-like drills in uniform., Manoj Jha wrote: “I write this to you to express my concern at the openly vengeful investigation being carried out by Delhi police in the matter of an alleged conspiracy to instigate and execute violence in Delhi.”, Jha added: “The latest in the list is Professor Apoorvanand, public intellectual and renowned academician from the University of Delhi…. The invocation of anti-terror laws against the student activists, floating in the media the alleged ‘disclosures’ and ‘confessions’ by Gulfisha, Meeran Haider and several others who are in judicial custody, only strengthens our belief that these investigations are vindictive and biased.”, Jha continued: “You may recall the Delhi High Court’s recent directives against publication of the police versions against accused under-trials. These would apply with greater force to those who are not even accused. We hope that looking at things as they appear, you will direct the government to stop the farcical media trial and drop these false charges against human rights activists, students and academicians.”, In July, Delhi High Court had reprimanded police for trying to sway public opinion against Jawaharlal Nehru University student Devangana Kalita — in jail after three FIRs were registered against her, including charges under the UAPA — by issuing media releases with selective information of the probe., On Friday, the high court reserved its order on Kalita’s bail plea after the police said they were a kilometre away from her and unable to record videos of her alleged inflammatory speeches. Kalita’s defence counsel and Congress leader Kapil Sibal, however, showed the court videos of police personnel video-recording the protest., The MP, in his letter, added: “We cannot help but remind you of the horrendous video from 24th February, which showed policemen forcing injured and bleeding Muslim youth to sing the national anthem. All patriots will be revolted at the debasing of the great song by the actions of these policemen. One of those injured young men later succumbed to his injuries. We do not know if any departmental action and criminal proceedings have been initiated against the guilty police officers. Following the violence, the Special Cell (of the police) has been spinning a theory that the violence was a result of a conspiracy planned and executed by those who have been part of the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act.”, He said: “By arresting and linking students and activists involved in the protests with the outbreak of violence, Delhi police (are) firstly criminalising the democratic right of the citizens to protest with the intention of silencing the voices against CAA. Secondly, this deflects attention from the role of the police and the administration who stood by and watched as houses burnt and people were killed.”, Manoj Jha has taught at the department of social work in DU since 2002 and did his MA and PhD from the university. Before that, he taught for eight years at Jamia Millia Islamia. Apoorvanand has taught at DU since 2004, before which he taught at Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishvavidyalaya, Wardha, and Magadh University, Bodh Gaya., Earlier this month, he was interrogated by the police for five hours and his mobile phone was seized.\n",

Still, we won 18 seats primarily because of the public’s mood in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said a party source., “Any fair assessment process should have started with the first question of whether we are now in a position to put up agents at 77,000-odd booths in the state,” the source added., On August 18 and 19, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, party’s co-in charge for Bengal Arvind Menon and other senior leaders like Rahul Sinha and Mukul Roy initiated the second round of a meetings to assess the party’s position in 154 Assembly constituencies. , Some party sources present at the assessment sessions — conducted at Dilip Ghosh’s Rajarhat address — said that the leaders were in a “self-congratulatory” mode., “The district presidents were presenting rosy pictures claiming that the situation is favourable for the party. Both state and central leaders present at the meeting took the district reports for granted, without asking many questions,” a party leader said., This section of leaders believes senior leaders like Ghosh are hoping for a rerun of the general election. But a series of events took place since then, which suggest Trinamul’s resurgence in several areas. , Not only the BJP failed to win in any of the three seats — including Kharagpur Sadar from where Ghosh was previously elected — in the Assembly bypolls, the political dynamics also changed in vast stretches of Bengal. , Trinamul successfully launched anti-NRC and anti-CAA campaigns. Besides, hundreds of BJP supporters switched over to the Trinamul Congress at several places., “Our leaders don’t appear to have taken note of all of these events, which indicate Trinamul, at least to some extent, is recovering the lost ground,” said a source., Speaking of Trinamul’s recovery, a BJP leader referred to the Arambagh Lok Sabha constituency, which the BJP had lost by a margin of around 1,100 votes., “We have reports that Trinamul is leaving no stone unturned to cement its base in Arambagh. If we don’t start building our organisation from now, it will be too late for the polls,” this leader said., This person reminded that a BJP supporter had been murdered on August 15 in Khanakul — which comes under the Arambagh constituency — in Hooghly and suggested that this incident was a proof of how desperate Trinamul had become., “What are our leaders doing? Have you seen a single centralised rally over this death? Why will common worker support us if we don’t support them?” the leader asked.\n",

            "editorial - Cause, not method: Protest movements in history - Telegraph India$ 21.08.20$On June 1913, at England’s most prestigious horse race, a woman ducked under the guard rail and ran onto the race course, stepped out right in front of the speeding King George V’s horse, brought it down, and succumbed to her injuries. The woman was Emily Davison, an English suffragette, who championed and fought ‘militantly’ for the voting rights of women in 20th century Britain. Davison had been arrested nine times for her confrontational tactics. Women demanding political rights since the 1800s were called Suffragists. Upon failing to convince the legislators, a group of women branched out to become ‘militant suffragettes’. To make themselves and their demands visible, they started burning mailboxes and vandalizing shop windows. This watershed event seems relevant to comprehend the nature of demonstrations and political assertions around the world today. , Following the vicious killing of the Afro-American, George Floyd, in Minneapolis by white police officers, there has been a tremendous global outrage against institutional racism. The Black Lives Matter movement has attained considerable global traction. However, shops have been looted and confederates’ statues toppled in the course of the movement. India, too, has been in ferment. The discriminatory Citizenship (Amendment) Act spurred nationwide discontent earlier in the year. These protests featured the blocking of roads, street demonstrations and, allegedly, incidents of destruction of public property. Instead of addressing the principal concern, the government and the media criticized the ‘violent’ nature of the protests., One aspect that has not changed in the course of a century is the brouhaha around the modus operandi of protests. The State can and has obliterated protests through ‘legitimate coercion’ by arguing that it has the authority to do so through the summation of power and legality. A confrontational demonstration from a disaffected people is deemed illegitimate by State institutions. This has led to the derailment of the demands and the legitimacy of the protesters on account of the charges of damage inflicted upon public property. The onus quickly shifted to the marginalized to work within the ‘social contract’ of the institutions that deprived them the rights and justice in the first place. The key question, however, is this: to what extent are the demonstrators represented in the social contract they have signed up for?, This is not to suggest that absolute impunity be given to those who damage public property. This may deflect attention from the cause of protest to its methods. What must be examined are the causes that force protesters to adopt a confrontational attitude. When the State legitimizes coercion by citing the principle of law and order, power groups controlling State institutions should be asked why they violated the sanctity of the social contract. The coercion of the people should bring an element of introspection for the State apparatus, which is keen on branding protesters as recalcitrant and delegitimizing their protests.  , To be political, Hannah Arendt asserts, is to decide everything through words and persuasion and not through violence and force. From its evolution as a process of decision-making in society, the expression, ‘political’, aligned itself with a set of institutions that were vested with the power to take such decisions. With the shift of power from society to State, the latter has acquired a significant political role as well as the responsibility to ensure justice. From the suffrage movement to Black Lives Matter, each mobilization has made our inability to address and resolve the root of resentment conspicuous. The tendency to focus on the strategies adopted by protest movements signifies the failure of political maturity in modernity.\n",

            "national-education-policy-nep - Recover memory: The sadness of anniversaries  - Telegraph India$ 21.08.20$Anniversaries tend to get repetitive and nagging in their emptiness. Independence Day, in particular, becomes problematic as both past and future look ambiguous. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru look like distant figures, creatures at the wrong end of a telescope. The immediacy of events like Covid-19 and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act seems starker, creating a general sense of helplessness. One looks around for the regime’s thinking on critical issues, like education, environment, security and what one discovers is a variety of reports. I was reading about the government’s ‘gift’ to the nation on this anniversary, the National Education Policy, based on the Kasturirangan Report. , One of the saddest things about our policy reports is that they become outdated in thought by the time of publication. The outdatedness is disguised by the presentation of ideas in the form of an intellectual salad. There is a little bit for everyone, each one picks his/her favourite hobby-horse of morsel, then speaks of it with relish. One realizes that there is no rethinking of fundamental issues, even in the most touted of reforms. The Kasturirangan Report has to be read at three levels., First, K. Kasturirangan is a major policy-maker, having chaired both the reports on the Western Ghats and the National Education Policy. The connectivity between the two is critical. Unlike Madhav Gadgil, Kasturirangan wanted development over diversity. In doing so, he stated two norms in general — the forest was a resource open to mining by industry rather than a commons of trusteeship. Second, the inhabitants living in it have little to say about the future. Kasturirangan’s marginalization of the forest and the tribe is lethal. The education report merely follows the logic of development. Here, he again pretends to be concerned about education, but his real concern is industry and the workforce for industry. It represents the Human Relations School of education, which has little to say about Taylorism or the invidiousness of class conflict. It creates a domain of social work where students play as NGOs, dabbling with the informal and the obsolescent as bits of nostalgia before they acquire corporate positions. Philanthropy plays happily, indifferent to the damage its corporate arm creates. The second point one has to emphasize is that the Kasturirangan Report on the NEP echoes a liberal arts view of education, stressing key words like ‘options’, ‘fluidity’ and ‘freedom’. The liberal arts schools are homes for elite children, but offer little else. They claim to be interdisciplinary, but are merely a goulash of subjects. The menu card of subjects is picked randomly. There is no sense of concept or cohesion. There is even less an idea of the debates that took place around the national movement or the great dialogue of religions that made India a syncretic society. Liberal arts is supposed to create a sense of civilization and memory, but the syllabus has little sense of both. It encourages dilettantes, but has little sense of rigour or scholarship., I was reminded of the liberal arts experiment while reading the Kasturirangan Report. It is amazing how accolades flow, from the elite, from IIT directors to management gurus. The elite likes the report, because it does not threaten their position. They love a report with a few key terms that they can bandy about like skill, multidisciplinarity, fluidity, and is garrulous on policy. Third-rate acclaims cushion second-rate thought, and we are content with the happy mediocrity it offers. Meanwhile, India is a nation which is being outthought and outfought on every front; creative originality is a discomfort we would rather be without. , The third aspect I wish to emphasize is that we have missed out on the great intellectual revolutions. We keep talking about the industrial revolution but have little sense of the later intellectual revolutions that followed. We have, despite our linguistic diversity, little sense of the linguistic revolution and, therefore, are blind to the brilliance of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, or to the work of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure was an originator of structural linguistics and a professor of Sanskrit in Geneva. Sapir-Whorf felt that original ideas could only be worked by innovative groups like the theosophists in India, but we played deaf to them. Idiotically, we still define language as a form of life, which needs a script and, thereby, we have destroyed over 2000 oral languages with an illiterate callousness. Strangely we have paid little attention to epistemology and the knowledge revolution, to the ecological revolution, or even to the debates on the Anthropocene. The elite feel content with the Linus blanket of mediocrity, callous about their own great innovators, from C.V. Seshadri to Amulya Reddy. India was home to so many diversities. Yet diversity in an epistemic or a cultural and linguistic sense is not part of our policy or the intellectual frameworks of our universities. India is not bothered whether it is home to 150,000 varieties of rice or over 2000 languages. Where do we have an education policy that says every school and every educational institution is to save at least one dying language, one obsolescent craft, or one near-extinct species? We talk pompously about skill, but never about competence as plurality. We tout skill as a poor man’s solution to livelihood, without linking skill and livelihood in any systematic way to the knowledge revolutions. , Sadly, we have missed out on the epistemic debates that have involved scientists, from Michael Polanyi and James Lovelock to Isabelle Stengers. Our scientists miss the excitement of the quantum revolution; we still treat science as a corset of Victorian methods we call the scientific temper. The science of complexity, risk and uncertainty eludes our policy-makers. We have destroyed the sense of play and childhood to create IITs, which add little to the research imagination. We have created an elite, which is instrumental about science, fetishizing technology. As a result, we have devalued science as a sense of play, as a cultural system, and overvalued technology. Now Indians prefer to be imitative by choice. As a leading scientist from Bangalore put it, “We have no original thoughts, but we can summarize other people brilliantly.” The kunji is in our genes. We are the greatest bowdlerizers of the West, from Nehru to Modi, but unlike the national movement we have no sense of the other West, of the defeated West. We swallowed the hegemonic West in vitaminized quantities and thought we would survive. It has created an insidious mediocrity., Yet, while we by-hearted the West, we ignored the dialogues of our own civilization. India could have been a great Islamic society, but we destroyed the possibility, thinking only of the minoritarianism of Islam or Christianity. Our civilizational syncretism would have challenged the Judeo-Christian idea of nature as commodity, and saved the tribal and the forest. We museumized living tradition, while the West museumized debt cultures. We were taxidermists of living cultures, which help create our fundamentalism. Our dialogue of civilizations with the West, as one option, would have created the new Santiniketans of the future. The loss of memory, the devaluation of morality as an epistemology of communication and community, is something we have to rethink. Democratic India has to rethink the contract among orality, textuality, and digitality., Modern India seems to have little sense of the future as a possibility. Our illiteracy about technology makes us technologize every future, reducing it to a unilinear, monotheistic, monolithic exercise. Our sense of modernity, which is part Victorian, ties us down. We cannot think of the future in the plural. As a society, our policy-makers as pedagogues have no sense of alternatives. As a result, our tribes, our crafts, our forests are fading before us. Our tragedy is that we have no dream of alternatives to challenge fundamentalism, or the empty secularism of modernity. This autism of the future goes back to our thinking in straitjackets, confusing options as choices, and restricting freedom to picking choices in a fixed choice questionnaire. As a society, we no longer dream of alternatives and we treat dissent and alternatives as unpatriotic. The depth of our mediocrity adds to the depth of our emerging authoritarianism. The uniqueness of this era is in the mediocrity of authoritarianism. India needs to dream and think differently, reinvent all its basic concepts — from democracy to development. If democracy cannot restore dream-time, it is doomed to the banality of authoritarianism. This was the message of Gandhi’s concepts of swadeshi and swaraj, which we need to revive today. This is the challenge of independence anniversaries, to recover memory so we can reinvent the future., The author is an academic associated with Compost Heap, a network pursuing alternative imaginations\n",

            "arvind-kejriwal - AAP Shaheen claim fuels ‘Nitish Jr’ barb - Telegraph India$ 19.08.20$The Aam Aadmi Party has found itself in a tight corner after its chief spokesperson linked the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh to the BJP., Although the protest abruptly ended on March 24 because of the pandemic-induced lockdown, the matter reappeared on the political firmament when a man named Shahzad Ali, who proclaimed that he was a “Shaheen Bagh activist”, joined the BJP on Sunday., The Shaheen Bagh protest, which was driven by women, began on December 15 and continued for over three months, becoming the longest and largest stir against the Centre’s new citizenship matrix., On Sunday, the BJP inducted 50 Muslims into the party, including Ali of the little-known Rashtriya Ulama Council party. After introducing himself as a “Shaheen Bagh activist”, Ali told news agency ANI: “I have joined the BJP to prove wrong those in our community who think that the BJP is our enemy. We’ll sit together with them over the CAA concerns.”, The AAP, which had attributed its defeat in six seats in east Delhi in the February Assembly polls to the communal polarisation due to the anti-CAA protests, was quick to jump at the opportunity., The AAP’s chief spokesperson and strident pro-Hindu face Saurabh Bharadwaj told a media conference on Monday: “The whole Shaheen Bagh protest was scripted by the BJP. The topmost leadership of the BJP scripted each and every step of the Shaheen Bagh protest. They decided who would say what, who would attack whom and then who would be launching the counter-attack., “All these things were pre-planned and well-scripted…. I do agree that there were many pro-democratic people who joined this protest. Many people joined this protest with the hope that it was pro-democracy. But they also did not understand that this Shaheen Bagh protest was just a brainchild and a script of the BJP.”, Bharadwaj’s statements created a future online with renewed allegations of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal being a “Nitish Jr” —  a reference to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who resurrected an alliance with the BJP after becoming a fulcrum of the Opposition., AAP’s social media managers unsuccessfully tried to contain the fallout of Bharadwaj’s statements, stressing that only “the section of protesters adamant on continuing to block the street” had joined the BJP., Shaheen Kausar, one of the organisers of the protest, called Bharadwaj’s statements “heart-breaking”., She said: “This was a leaderless protest and although Shahzad Ali was one of those who regularly attended, he never had any role in organising the protest. If AAP knew that all that we women were doing was a BJP plot, why did they keep silent for so long? They swept the polls, so what benefit are they claiming the BJP got from our protest?, “One can understand that the BJP wants to induct people associated with the protest in order to create an impression that people have accepted their unjust law. But the people of Shaheen Bagh will ask AAP leaders why they are speaking the language of the BJP.”, In another news conference on Tuesday, Bharadwaj blamed BJP leaders Amit Shah, Yogi Adityanath, Anurag Thakur and Giriraj Singh, among others, for the communal riots in Delhi in February. The AAP spokesperson, however, continued his tirade against Shaheen Bagh.\n",

            "bharatiya-janata-party-bjp - Karnataka revives plan to ban Social Democratic Party of India  - Telegraph India$ 16.08.20$The BJP has revived its plans to ban the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), an offshoot of the outlawed Students Islamic Organisation of India (Simi), whose footprints have been found in several instances of communal violence, including the recent arson and vandalism in Bangalore., The political wing of the Popular Front of India, which claims to be a social organisation but is seen as harbouring Right-wing tendencies, the SDPI had allegedly played a key role in the violence late on Tuesday in which an MLA’s house, two police stations and hundreds of vehicles were set ablaze in the Karnataka capital’s east, triggering police firing in which three persons died. More than 60 policemen were injured., “We will take the decision to ban both the SDPI and the PFI during our cabinet meeting on August 20,” Karnataka panchayati raj and rural development minister K.S. Eshwarappa told reporters in Shimoga on Friday. Both the PFI and the SDPI trace their roots to Simi, which was banned soon after the 9/11 attacks in the US. The PFI and the SDPI are active in Karnataka, Kerala and also Tamil Nadu., In January, the BJP government in Karnataka had tried to ban the SDPI during the anti-CAA protests. “The government is under pressure from various organisations to ban these groups whose leaders were behind the violence,” Eshwarappa said., A derogatory Facebook post by P. Naveen, nephew of local Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy, had sparked the Bangalore violence., Revenue minister R. Ashoka said preliminary investigations had revealed that the SDPI had played a key role in fuelling the mob frenzy. “Their activists are also among those arrested. So the government has to take a call on the demand to ban them,” Ashoka said., Among those held for the violence is Congress councillor Irshad Begum’s husband Kaleem Pasha, who allegedly has links with the SDPI. None from the SDPI has commented on the Bangalore violence., The Dakshina Kannada district secretary of the CPM, Vasant Achari, questioned the logic behind banning these groups overlooking the fact that their rivals were Hindutva fundamentalists., “First of all, I don’t believe in banning any group. What happened after Simi was banned? They renamed themselves as PFI, SDPI and KFD (Karnataka Forum for Dignity). So they basically reappear with other names,” he told The Telegraph on Saturday., “Are those who are trying to ban them any less communal? Why are they leaving out the Hindutva groups like the Sree Rama Sene and the Bajrang Dal that’s been creating so much of trouble?” Achari asked.\n",

            "jammu-and-kashmir - One year of abrogation of Article 370 and communication lockdown in Kashmir - Telegraph India$ 04.08.20$Most moments come to pass; some moments extend themselves in ways that they become annotations on eras. This day last year was such a moment, an oracular dissertation on why and how we had arrived at August 5, 2019, and what lay ahead. It was a moment that defined to humanity yet again the fatal error of confusing elections, even popular elections, with democracy. The latter is not always the consequence of the former, it can often be its casualty., The dismemberment and downgrading of Jammu and Kashmir, the cold stripping and silencing of what used to be India’s prided crown, were decisions of a popularly elected government, the most handsomely mandated executive in decades. No element of those decisions was democratic — not the way they were arrived at, not the way they were effected. That said, Kashmir’s was a popular humiliation, a rapturously popular one, whose din drowned protest to a feebleness and eventually drained it; it was the popularity the hunter enjoys in a hunt over the hunted. That was the ritual of the rite, the jungle ritual of might is right. Nobody can rightfully complain they did not see it coming, the jungle cannot complain about itself. An elected jungle is still a jungle, it is decreed to live by its ways. That decree was popularly handed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi &amp; Co in May 2019. It was a decree vastly different from the decree of 2014. Understanding the difference is the key to understanding what Modi’s formulation of New India is. It is a majoritarian formulation, not a democratic one., Modi rode to power in 2014 on the weary spine of the UPA decade, its dissipated energies, its internal debasement and decay, its atrophied will, its palpable lack of mass connect; Modi seemed to embody all the happy contrasts. Modi’s endorsement in 2019, a bigger and resounding ratification, was earned entirely on his own speed. He had demonstrated the will and the potential for doing ‘what no other leader had been able to do in 70 years’. That’s open code for the establishment of Hindu majoritarianism. It has many layers to it, that code — from cow and beef lynch mobs and their celebration to “shamshan-kabristan” speeches to Othering for attire to the empowerment of Adityanath and Pragya Thakur to the denigration of Gandhi and the deification of Godse, the entire narrative of civilizational anger and avenging. Like Pulwama, followed by Balakot. That was the message that won Modi 2019. What has followed are merely consequences. The overriding mood of 2019 wasn’t for electing a democrat; it had been seduced by a demagogue and his diabolical promise. Everything that has happened since was written into the mandate., I was in Kashmir on assignment from this newspaper this day last year. And this, briefly, is what happened., At 12.26 am, I began writing a telephone text to my office: “Don’t know what the cabinet will decide in Delhi tomorrow, but the iron curtain is about to...”, My phone snapped. Like at the throw of some switch somewhere. The signal towers collapsed. Internet was gone. I ran down to the landline. Dead. I tried heading out, but there was nowhere to go. There were pickets and barricades, and soldiers frilled out around spools of concertina wires. Lockdown., I may have never ever felt so shut out and so shut down. Not during the protracted military operations of the IPKF in northern Sri Lanka. Not during the many weeks I was on the frontier reporting the Kargil war. Not during the Tahrir Square uprising in Cairo. Not even during the darkest I have witnessed in Kashmir over the past decades., All through the widespread eruption of armed militancy and the consequent flight of Pandits from the Valley in 1989-90, there was always the old reliable Post and Telegraph Office to carry your typewritten copy to for transmission., This was not even censorship, not about what you could or couldn’t report. This was being cut out and left cold. We were lost to the world, cauterized from all that existed beyond. There was no recourse, nobody to turn to, nobody to tell we even continued to exist, breathe, eat, pray, bray., This is how Kashmir was taken and was made to become “normal”. It beggared belief at the time that I considered myself the citizen of a democracy. It still does. I got out a few days later, but that could be of no solace to those I had left behind, fellow citizens so-called, who trade in the Indian rupee and, when required, produce an Aadhaar card or an Indian passport., What democracy so utterly and absolutely deprives its citizenry? What democracy celebrates such violent dispossession of those it calls its own? What democracy stirs not a little finger to say, look, what’s happening is not right, you cannot do it to a people, not to those you call your own, not to those you sat and supped with till just the other day. What democracy rejoices in denying to others what it seeks to possess for itself? I shall go on pilgrimage to Amarnath but I shall piss on your walls on the way there. What democracy does that?, But that is what we have made of ourselves, that is what we voted for, that is what we invested in and installed in power — a majoritarianism. It’s misplaced to blame Narendra Modi &amp; Co. They were clear and upfront with their agenda; it was all in their manifesto, the bold print, the fine print, what lay there to be read between the lines. This nation voted for what became the CAA, this nation voted for what is going to be the NRC, this nation voted, eyes wide open, for Narendra Modi, a man who likened a pogrom to the death of a pilla, or pup. It must live with the consequences and believe that at 50,000-plus infections a day, we are doing gloriously tackling the coronavirus and that there are no Chinese troops squatting on Indian soil. We should also believe that “goli maaro sa***n ko” is a patriotic cry and reading the Preamble to the Constitution anti-national. We should believe that habeas corpus is no plea to urgency over ensuring human rights, and that the lies of a salaried solicitor must always override the truth of what we can see, whether it is migrants walking thousands of harried miles home or an elderly gent protesting from behind a concertina mesh that he is chained when the world is being told he is free. We must believe the freedom of his chains because it is lies we chose., We are about to be told more lies this day, in continuation of the consecration of crimes. This day is such a moment, when democracy appears a casualty of elections, not its consequence. Kashmir described how that happened and what it would lead to. It was a dry run on the tools and methods of subjugation, on the uses of lies and propaganda, on the subversion of institutions and integrity, on the populist derailing of democracy.

            "kashmir - letters to the editor 28 July 2020: Jeff Bezos net worth jump  rise of the far right  remembering Amala Shankar - Telegraph India$ 28.07.20$Sir — It was astonishing to hear that the net worth of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, increased by 13 billion in one day, the biggest jump since the creation of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As people around the world face a severe economic crisis with massive job cuts, tech giants seem to be gaining financially. Experts have long advocated for a progressive tax system with certain administrations already taking measures to tax big businesses more. The pandemic has exposed the failure of governments to tackle a health and economic crisis. Taxing the uber-rich proportionately could be a step towards rectifying the gap.Richa Trivedi,Calcutta, Red flags, Sir — Most nations around the world are increasingly inching towards the far Right, with some States like China, Russia and Turkey becoming totalitarian while others selectively destroy democratic traditions (“Weak spot”, July 24). Several political leaders and parties in many countries have, unfortunately, illustrated that the way to political longevity is through a combination of authoritarianism and conservative policies under a thin veneer of democracy. , Turkey, under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has moved away from the secular vision of its first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, paving the way for religious conservatism. The recent reconversion of the Hagia Sophia, a monument with a rich multicultural history, from a museum to a mosque reminded one of the religious strife in our own country that led to the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya for supposedly being constructed at the site of a Ram temple. , The United States of America, which has been a world leader for much of the last century, is now facing an unprecedented political crisis. The disposition of the US president, Donald Trump, is quite similar to that of the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi. Their tenures so far have been plagued with comparable problems. Both leaders represent a conservative section of the electorate whose demands often come at the expense of the vulnerable., As strongman leaders take up positions of power in various countries, the political situation, as can be witnessed in the face-off between India and China, is increasingly becoming antagonistic. One hopes that the Bharatiya Janata Party, in its relentless quest for power, does not dilute the democratic vision of the founding fathers of India., R. Narayanan,Navi Mumbai, Sir — The changing dynamics between India and its neighbours, along with the country’s proximity with the US have grave implications for international politics. India’s disregard for the issues of its long-term allies is alarming. The abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the partitioning of the erstwhile state into two separate Union territories was viewed unfavourably by China and Pakistan. However, the Indian government refused to discuss the issue on a global platform, arguing that it was an internal matter. , It is unfortunate that while we are battling a pandemic, the political situation has flared up in the border areas. The matter cannot be neglected, but it must be pointed out that it is the failures of the political leadership and intelligence organizations that have led to this escalation. The situation in Kashmir, too, must be resolved at the earliest. It is a shame that Kashmiris still do not have unrestricted access to the internet. , India’s worsening diplomatic relations with China and Pakistan cannot be viewed in isolation from the BJP’s domestic policies. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens have deeply polarized the country and led to the arrests of several students and activists. The democratic ethos of our country will be lost if the ordinary people are afraid of criticizing the government for fear of being charged with sedition. The political leadership must rethink its strategies at this point.Jaspreet Singh,Patiala, Last dance, Sir — The passing away of Amala Shankar, the legendary danseuse and choreographer, marks the end of an era (“Amala Shankar passes away at 101”, July 25). She, along with her husband, Uday Shankar, played a key role in modernizing traditional Indian dance forms on the global stage. Shankar had a long and successful career that began in Paris when she was an 11-year-old, and she continued to be active till she was 92, taking part in a final piece, Missing You, composed by her son, Ananda Shankar., Interestingly, it was Subhas Chandra Bose — he saw her perform with Jnan Prakash Ghosh on the tabla and Dilip Roy on vocals — who recommended that her father send her to Uday Shankar’s dance centre in Almora. In 1948, she played the lead role in the experimental dance film, Kalpana. Although the film did not do well at the box office, Satyajit Ray was said to have watched it 11 times., Shankar had a graceful and luminous stage presence, and was an inspiration to many young Indian women who could never dream of performing in public or in front of the camera in the 1930s and 1940s. She was also a fine painter, working primarily with her fingers and had a solo exhibition in 2013. Her death has left an irreplaceable void in the field of arts and culture.Khokan Das,Calcutta, Sir — The demise of the legendary dancer, Amala Shankar, is a great loss for our country. Not only was she a remarkable danseuse but also a fine actress. She mesmerized the world with her performance in Kalpana. She will also be remembered as a writer — she released her formerly-serialized biographical reminiscences, Shankarnama, last year — and a painter. Her legacy will live on through her exceptional and vast body of work.Sourish Misra,Calcutta\n",

            "supreme-court-of-india - How dissent in India is dealt with - Telegraph India$ 27.07.20$Holding or expressing opinion at variance with those commonly or officially held is the meaning of the word, dissent, in an accessible dictionary. But in India, dissent has many meanings and many unexpected applications — and some forms of dissent appear to be more equal than others. Ruling on the petition of the Speaker of the Rajasthan assembly, the Supreme Court pronounced that the voice of dissent cannot be suppressed in a democracy. The court was reiterating a fundamental principle of the democratic ethos, which draws its sap from varied opinions and approaches, and creates harmony out of diversity. The principle is of extraordinary importance today, when dissent from or criticism of the Narendra Modi-led government’s policies and actions is labelled ‘anti-national’ — earlier it was usually sedition — and the dissenters charged under laws against conspiracy, against incitement through speeches or the instigation of violence. Teachers, writers, lawyers, activists arrested for allegedly inciting the Bhima-Koregaon violence, for links to ultra-Left groups and a conspiracy to assassinate the prime minister have been in jail for two years, while students and young people protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens are still being arrested, often charged with causing the violence in northeast Delhi., The Speaker of the Rajasthan assembly had petitioned the Supreme Court to stay the order of the Rajasthan High Court that barred the Speaker from disqualifying till the following Friday Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress members of the legislative assembly. The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the petition. Members of a party have the right to dissent, to criticize their party, felt the court, and not attending a meeting could not be considered anti-party activity. The issue whether there could be judicial intervention before a Speaker had set the disqualification process in motion was presumably considered irrelevant. That the group was incommunicado during an interlude in which the members stayed in a hotel in Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Haryana did not seem to be of any relevance either. The Supreme Court’s emphasis on the importance of dissent in a democracy is of overwhelming importance; its full impact, however, can only be appreciated in conditions of neutrality or, rather, under circumstances free of direct political tension and disagreement. The principle loses clarity otherwise.\n",

Another firm, named Social Central Media Solutions LLP and based at 70A, 601 Pressman House, describes itself as “a Signpost India Company” on its website and lists the Maharashtra CEO among its clients., Social Central’s managing director is Devang Virendra Dave, also listed as “Incharge” of “National Social Media and IT” on the website of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha., Social Central’s website also carries a testimonial attributed to Shirish Mohod, deputy CEO during last year’s Assembly polls, that says: “I want to appreciate Social Central Media Solutions to all your creative inputs and effective implementation of the digital campaign which has helped us in our endeavour of reaching out to non-registered voters of our state.”, While Dave doesn’t feature on the list of Signpost India directors, he has posted a tweet that links him to the CEO-sponsored campaign., “We do not earn our bread and butter by doing any kind of ‘Dalali’ but by Hardwork. The work assigned by Election Commission to Signpost was after following due process. There is no illegality whatsoever. Is it also forbidden for political activists to make an honest living?” he posted., “We all know the reputation of people who have tried to put allegations on me. This (sic) are same people who were against CAA. This are same people who are against Ram Mandir. This are same people who are against Idea Of Bharat! I thank each one of you who stand by me.”Gokhale had tweeted: “Devang Dave is also the founder of websites and pages like ‘The Fearless Indian’, ‘I Support Narendra Modi’ etc. His agency lists the BJP (naturally) as a client along with other govt. entities. The above pages are full of h@teful political content of BJP IT Cell.”, He had added: “It is beyond shocking that the Election Commission chose a BJP IT cell guy &amp; his agency to handle their social media for Maharashtra elections. ECI is supposed to be monitoring social media of parties during election. Here, they *literally* worked with the ruling party.”, On Thursday evening, Election Commission spokesperson Sheyphali Sharan tweeted: “Regarding tweet of Mr Gokhale @SaketGokhale, Commission has sought detailed factual report in this matter from CEO Maharashtra with respect to alleged locale of the incidence immediately.”, Asked about the rules for hiring private firms, Sharan said the selection was done by the CEOs and that the Election Commission in Delhi was not involved., Gokhale on Friday cited news reports that suggested that the transfer of previous CEO Ashwani Kumar, three months before the October 2019 Assembly polls, had come under pressure from then BJP chief minister Devendra Fadnavis., Baldev Singh, the current CEO, replied to a WhatsApp message from this newspaper saying: “It is misleading and incorrect to suggest that the office of chief electoral officer has issued any advertisement through any agency on political considerations. As per standard practice, electoral awareness campaign is launched through the information and public relations department (DGIPR), Government of Maharashtra. They, in turn, follow a laid-down procedure for selecting an appropriate agency for public awareness and not by CEO Office.”, Singh added: “For the specific imputation made in the tweet of Mr Saket Gokhale, an interim reply of facts has been sent to Election Commission of India. Meanwhile, some other representations on the matter have been received from some public representatives, which are also being addressed and a detailed response in this regard shall be sent to the commission soon.”, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Sachin Sawant has demanded a probe by the poll panel., Mohod, now attached to the state home department, denied giving any testimonial to Social Central., “How can I give statements to some company that we didn’t engage?” he told this newspaper., Ajay Ambekar, director (information) at the DGIPR, told this newspaper: “We have given our reply to the CEO.

            "book-review - Review: In the name of the nation: India and its Northeast by Sanjib Baruah - Telegraph India$ 24.07.20$Sanjib Baruah ends In the Name of the Nation: India and its Northeast with the following statement: “…the peoples of Northeast India… will continue their struggles for the realization of a more robust form of democratic citizenship.” It throws light on the region’s ongoing post-colonial predicament and the shortcomings of a territorially circumscribed Indian nation state especially in contemporary times when questions of citizenship, with CAA/NRC in the offing, have taken center stage on the social and political landscape in India. Baruah has engaged with themes of State, nation, nationalism, sub/ethno-nationalism, nation-building, sovereignty, democracy and citizenship in the context of Northeast India since India Against Itself: Assam and the Politics of Nationality, one of his well-known works. He argues that the politics of ideas, representations and, consequently, exclusion has always been a strong point of contention in the writings on and from the Northeast. This may not seem like a new themefor someone who has been following Baruah’s intellectual and academic trajectory but the book is a reminder that some issues need constant revisiting, more so in the times we live in. However, for those who are starting to delve into the making of a prolonged and convoluted narrative of nation-building and State-making in India vis-à-vis India’s Northeast through different regimes (planters’, ethno-territorial, AFSPA, hybrid-political, developmental) will find this to be a good starting point., At the outset, Baruah states that he treats the region as a ‘process geography’ that is always in the making, thereby apprising readers to expect a processual account in the following pages. The book, which is neatly arranged into six chapters along with an introduction and a conclusion, presents a narrative about a region which Baruah sees as a compelling example of representative democracy’s ‘post-colonial neo-life’. In its new life, democracy is reduced to procedures with contradictions and irony that are not paid enough attention. Interestingly, despite the existence of various governments (with differing political ideologies) at the Centre, their relationship with the region has been built on a similar understanding. Baruah describes this relationship as that between the “manager and managed”, alluding to an official reality that is only possible with a structural framework that has been methodically put in place over decades of State-making and governance in the region. , He thus undertakes the task of deconstructing this framework by interrogating the numerous processes and sites that are instrumental in creating official narrative(s). He looks at these as the result of specific kinds of political sensibilities (informed by a ‘colonial ethno-territorial frame’ leading to visual orientalism) and evident in constitutional provisions, amendments, legislatures, ad hoc policies and the spoken word of officials. He further highlights the role of mass media, popular culture and statist propaganda in creating a discursive reality about the ‘Other’ who is seen as an existential threat to State and nation. This way of seeing is so systemically and eloquently crafted that it is difficult to look beyond these discourses of power unless it is critically and comprehensively analysed. To counter this dominant narrative and to reveal the failure of the ‘political imagination of state-centric thinking and analysis’, Baruah underlines the need to engage with demotic processes and narratives about dissent and resistance, States-in-waiting, construction and circulation of popular memory about pain, loss and struggles, the vernacularization of democracy, development and modernization in the region. , Baruah starts each chapter with a quote and sets its tone. The reference list for the book is extensive, including references to the rich scholarship and intellectual traditions in the region to build a holisticperspective. However, despite being presented with a thorough narrative from the years of engagement of the author with the issues that are explored in the book, constant references to academic literature in each chapter break the flow of the narrative. Given that the book foregrounds the post-colonial imbroglio of the Northeast, which is largely unknown to many from other parts of India, the style might become a hurdle in reaching a wider readership., Notwithstanding the above issue, the title of the book is reminiscent of the pledge of resistance, ‘Not in Our Name’, by Saul Williams in the United States of America as well as of the people’s movement with a similar name in India. It does make one wonder if Baruah’s book should be read more for its subtext that is suggestive of the hope that one day the people would be able to see beyond the State-centric official narratives and the nation might finally be able to say, ‘not in my name’.\n",

            "narendra-modi - Dispersing the women sitting in protest at Shaheen Bagh because of  the pandemic will  not erase its transforming memory - Telegraph India$ 19.07.20$The Narendra Modi government had given India a unique gift; it is sheer bad luck that the novel coronavirus should compel its withdrawal. The gift was not willingly given, but had the government not pushed through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens for the whole country then the months-long sit-in at Shaheen Bagh, Delhi would not have happened. At the time, the government was on a roll, pushing through legislations on the strength of its majority in Parliament against protests from the Opposition and sections of the people as though democracy was just a crude matter of numbers, ignoring questions about the discriminatory purpose of the CAA and the possible exclusionary intention of the NRC, while allowing the violent repression of protests. Then Shaheen Bagh happened., Muslim women from a locality of that name came out of their houses and sat on the ground close by: without fuss, they said this was their land and they would not leave it for CAA or NRC or anything else. Their gathering radiated peace, goodwill and welcome — the prime minister never did accept their repeated invitation to tea so that they could ‘talk’ — and they spoke of no religious cause. They held up the Constitution and the Indian flag. Their presence, day after day, even through the Delhi winter, showed India what peaceful protest is like: immovable, democratic — there were no leaders, only organizers — and completely disciplined, united in a common purpose. It was as though elements from the visions of Gandhi and Ambedkar, whose picture was displayed, had taken shape. Only political leaders with their speeches were forbidden. The women’s presence under their own agency was a glorious example of the equality the Constitution aims at. They came from precisely that segment of the population that various shades of political and privileged opinion, with condescending concern, consider to be backward, voiceless and put upon in their own society. Shaheen Bagh gave divided and misogynistic India that immemorial moment when not just members of a community often discriminated against, but its women, led a quiet and intransigent protest movement that no one could match. Its hold on constitutional ideals was unmatched too. Muslim women led a truly secular movement which all communities, classes, ages and genders could join, help or participate in, and which spawned similar movements across the country. Shaheen Bagh shone as a microcosm of what India was meant to be — and can still become., No pandemic can take Shaheen Bagh away. That two books have been published on it is one manifestation of the deep impression it has made on many. The character of the protest would ensure that many more would have felt its transforming touch than the books can reach. It is now a reference point, a dream of the possible, a revelation of potential to which, irrespective of text books, history can keep aspiring.\n",

            "china - India-China clash: Minister chants UPA, UPA, UPA but little about current mess - Telegraph India$ 18.07.20$The Narendra Modi government fielded external affairs minister S. Jaishankar to respond to Rahul Gandhi’s three-and-a-half-minute video on the China conflict, but the minister’s 10 tweets sidestepped the state of India’s relations with the world now and instead focused on foreign relations during the UPA years., Relations with Kathmandu are at an all-time low after Nepal included three areas that are in India in its new map; Bangladesh is smarting over the fact that the ruling party in India has repeatedly vilified the country as part of its narrative on the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act; and while relations with Sri Lanka and Maldives have improved in recent months after a change of government in both islands, the Chinese footprint in both countries is evident., But Jaishankar began with the preface that: “Our major partn’ships are strongr &amp; internat’l standng higher. Witness regular summits &amp; informal meetngs wth #US #Russia #Europe &amp; #Japan. India engages #China on more equal terms politically. Ask the analysts.”, This was followed by nine tweets, each ending on a similar note: ask the media, jawans, businesses, security or citizens., Jaishankar highlighted the signing of the Land Boundary Agreement in 2015 with Bangladesh, prime ministerial visits after 17 years with Nepal, and the completion of the Salma Dam and Parliament complex projects in Afghanistan as proof of the Modi government’s better performance., What he omitted mentioning was that the land boundary agreement was finalised by the UPA government but not signed because of domestic politics in India, and the Salma Dam and Parliament complex in Afghanistan were work in progress that the Modi government inherited., On Pakistan, the minister attempted to suggest that India’s response to terror attacks under the Modi government was tougher than during the UPA years, drawing attention to the surgical strikes without using the term., “Bhutan finds a stronger security and development partner. And unlike 2013, they don’t worry about their cooking gas,’’ Jaishankar wrote., In 2013, under the UPA, India had withdrawn all subsidy on kerosene and cooking gas supplied to Bhutan apparently because the then Bhutanese Prime Minister, Jigme Thinley, was seen to be cosying up to China. This was reversed a month later after Bhutan sought a review., Rahul had mentioned the Hambantota port that Sri Lanka has given on a 99-year lease to China. Jaishankar was quick to point out the deal was done in 2008., China had in 2008 agreed to give a loan to Sri Lanka to construct the port after India refused because of doubts over its commercial viability. In 2017, when Sri Lanka was unable to pay back the loan because the port did not generate enough traffic and revenue, Colombo signed the lease with the Chinese state-run shipping company., The minister also flagged the border infrastructure. “Compare 2014-20 with 2008-14. Budget up by 280%, road building by 32%, bridges by 99% and tunnels by 6 times,” he wrote., The minister’s long rebuttal, however, did not answer the question Rahul had asked and which many in India are asking: Why has China chosen to act with such aggression at this time?\n",

With serious allegations against several senior police officials of being complicit in the violence or assisting the mobs or standing mutely and watching the violence, there is bound to be a perception that the agency is shielding its own.”, The letter to the President cites news report on alleged police complicity in the riots, custodial torture of victims, inaction on complaints against the BJP, criminalising protests by making unwarranted links to the riots, and malafide harassment of anti-CAA protesters during interrogation., They also cited the Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) report on the riots, released on Thursday, as well as an order from special commissioner of police Praveer Ranjan on July 8 to take “due care and precaution” during arrests as Hindu community leaders had been resentful of recent arrests., The petition says: “A credible and unbiased probe is crucial to ensure public trust. The investigation cannot be allowed to become a fishing and roving expedition aimed at causing a chilling effect on dissent and protest in the country. We therefore call upon the government of India to institute an inquiry into this investigation under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, by appointing sitting/retired judge(s) of the higher judiciary., “Further, it must be ensured that officers accused of being complicit in the violence are not involved in the investigation by the Delhi police.”, The signatories include former secretaries of Union ministries Abhijit Sengupta, Alok Perti, Brijesh Kumar, Chandrashekhar Balakrishnan, E.A.S.

Modi said that Atmanirbhar Bharat was aimed at integrating India’s domestic production to global supply chains., On Tuesday, EU officials had expressed concerns about India’s protectionist streak of raising tariffs and calls for self-reliance while ruling out the possibility of the EU accepting commerce minister Piyush Goyal’s suggestion for an “early harvest deal”. They said the EU was more interested in a deal that had broad coverage., Given the current shift in the global order, both sides envisaged a greater role for the EU at a time the US is retreating from various multilateral fora. Both the sides affirmed their commitment to promoting effective multilateralism in the face of growing unilateralism by the US and a rule-based multilateral order pivoted around the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation., China came up during the discussions, but all that European Council president Charles Michel was ready to divulge was that the Prime Minister apprised him and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen of the situation along the Line of Actual Control. The EU, Michel said, was keen to see the two countries resolve the issue peacefully., To a direct question on which country is of greater strategic importance to the EU — China or India — the EU leadership said, “Both are important to us and both are very different”; the main difference being political in that India is a democracy with which the EU shares the principles of liberty and freedom. Though the EU has a difficult relationship with China, it is not yet ready to side with the US in its muscle flexing with Beijing., Michel said the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) did come up during the discussions and “we trust the Indian institutions’ ability to deal with them; we understand the Supreme Court is looking into it”., In January, the majority of the members of the European parliament had moved a resolution on the CAA’s discriminatory nature and how it violated the Indian Constitution and universal values, but deferred a vote till after this summit, which was earlier scheduled to be held in March.\n",

Not from collective memory - Telegraph India$ 15.07.20$The Shaheen Bagh movement has inspired two books during the lockdown, which abruptly halted the spontaneous protest led by women against the new citizenship matrix in the heart of the capital., Journalist couple Ziya Us Salam and Uzma Ausaf’s Shaheen Bagh: From a Protest to a Movement is a bestseller in the pre-order stage on Amazon for over a month now. A collection of interviews, essays, reports and photographs titled Shaheen Bagh and the Idea of India, edited by veteran journalist Seema Mustafa, is due for release on Wednesday., Just before the lockdown, Bhopal-based activist Ishrat Khan’s Shaheen Bagh Hoon Main — a Hindi primer on the changes in laws and the background of the longest-running street protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act — was released at the protest site., Police evicted the women on March 24, after the Supreme Court’s mediation had failed to move them. The women had stayed put for more than three months since December 15, when they came out of their homes and simply sat down on the street after the police went on the rampage at Jamia Millia Islamia where students were protesting against the citizenship matrix., Even after the peak had subsided by February, several people who were not organisers would still come and spend their day in the sun listening to the poetry, speeches and slogans. The community formed around the protest thrives now on social media., The books take a supportive view of the protests that inspired several such gatherings across the country, all led by largely Muslim women., Salam told The Telegraph: “We saw women who would not be deterred by slander — allegations by the BJP’s Amit Malviya that they were there for Rs 500 and some biryani. They were not browbeaten by attacks (firing by a fanatic, and attempted arson). They stayed there through the Delhi winter…. My wife and I spent time there and often stayed the night. This book is the result.”, Salam, a journalist in the capital for three decades who is now with Frontline, found the protest remarkable because the women stayed the course in large numbers and without turning violent., “These were women who came out in protest for the first time. They had never turned out against the triple talaq, the Babri demolition or even when the court gave the (Ayodhya) land to the Hindus. They weren’t there for a Muslim cause. They held the Tricolour and the Constitution in either hand, not the Quran or the Shariat,” he said., The book also talks about the prominent non-Muslim organisers, like Upasana Sharma, D.S. Bindra and the Sikh peasants from Punjab who fed protesters., “The place became a metaphor of resistance with people naming protest sites across India as Shaheen Bagh…. It will not die simply due to a lockdown.”, Mustafa’s book includes essays by author Nayantara Sahgal, activists Harsh Mander and Subhashini Ali, lawyer Nandita Haksar, political scientist Zoya Hasan and several others., “The book was done at the time of the protest, and we had finished work on it by the time the Delhi (communal) violence had ended (in late February). The release was delayed due to the lockdown…. The movement was an assertion of democracy and a common thread running through these essays is the Idea of India — of peace and communal harmony,” Mustafa said., She explained that in her professional memory of covering social movements in India since the 1980s, Shaheen Bagh stands out for its nationwide appeal, peaceful nature and the strident expression of constitutionalism., “If we were working on the book today, we could draw parallels with the Black Lives Matter movement…. In fact, in our history there have been several movements, be that of Dalits, or the movement against the CAA where we see such parallels. As a journalist, our job is not to dismiss them but understand them,” she said.\n",

They have to come clear on this before Bengal elections. If they do not, we will start a movement that forces them to clear their stand,” Bose said., Bengal being a bordering state and home to hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Bangladesh, clarity on the Centre’s views on the citizenship matrix assumes urgency., Shah was supposed to visit Thakurnagar, home to many from the Matua community — lower-caste Hindus from Bangladesh, many of whom want the new citizenship laws here., But Thakurnagar was dropped from Shah’s itinerary. Instead, he will now head to Midnapore, Trinamul turncoat Suvendu Adhikari’s turf., Bose said they had all heard BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya say that citizenship will be given to all refugees by February. “But Vijayvargiya is not a minister...Shah must clarify whether the home ministry intends to do the same or whether Vijayvargiya is bluffing,” Bose said., Forum members cited examples of different voices from the BJP on the citizenship matrix to stress why clear answers from Shah were vital., For instance, in December 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stated there had been no discussion on “the word NRC” during his five-year-old tenure, ignoring home minister Amit Shah’s repeated claims that the citizenship amendment would be followed by a countrywide NRC update to identify and expel “ghuspetiyas (infiltrators)”., Bose said Shah must spell out the Centre’s stand on the BJP-led Assam government about a fresh NRC. “After inconveniencing so many people for so many years, the Assam BJP is now saying that if they come to power again they will prepare a fresh NRC. Shah should make it clear whether the home ministry shares the same view,” he added., Pratip Nag, another member, said the forum wanted all amendments to the citizenship act passed in 1955 to be repealed. “We want all amendments to be repealed. The 1955 Act was the most inclusive and most secular. It said whoever was born in India would become a citizen, irrespective of whether a person’s parents were born in India or not,” said Nag.\n",

            "op-ed - Making history: An archive for the future - Telegraph India$ 18.12.20$As the year limps to its close — not with a bang, but a whimper — and the scale and extent of the devastation caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus gradually become apparent, even as the first vaccines have begun to be administered in countries across the globe, there seems to be unanimity about only one thing — that 2020 will go down as a defining year in human history, and future chroniclers will have much grist for their analytic mills as they try to make sense of what happened and, maybe more crucially, what could have but did not happen, in these last twelve months. The archives that future historians will sift through in the years to come, in physical and digital forms, have already started to take on vast proportions, and it seems unlikely that there will ever be a consensus about the causes, effects, and efforts to combat the virus undertaken by individuals, institutions, nation states, and multinational entities. Much will depend, of course, on when humanity as a whole is able to live with the virus, in much the same way in which it has become accustomed to live with other viruses (the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS springs most readily to mind in this context). If we are able to effectively eradicate the virus (as we did with smallpox) or contain it (polio), then Covid-19 is something our descendants will encounter as a minor footnote in our history. If, on the other hand, as some have predicted, the virus mutates, multiplies, and continues to disrupt lives then there is no predicting where this particular story will end., These thoughts were prompted by three recent events, each of which has the potential to take on wider and deeper historical importance, and one of proven historical significance which is approaching the half-century mark. The three recent events are, in chronological order, the demonetization of November 8, 2016; the widespread agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act passed by the Indian Parliament on December 11, 2019; and the ongoing farmers’ agitation in the capital city that began on the 25th of last month. The half-century-old event is the defeat of the Pakistani forces through the combined efforts of Bangladeshi freedom fighters and India’s armed forces on December 16, 1971., I had the great good fortune to be present at a ‘Vijay Diwas’ (‘Victory Day’) celebration held on December 16 this year to commemorate the birth of Bangladesh, where former mukti joddhas (Bangladeshi freedom fighters), retired soldiers from Bangladesh’s and India’s armed forces who had served during the Liberation War of 1971, and civilians who had played important roles before, during, and after the war were present to share their thoughts and experiences. As I listened to the matter-of-fact accounts of these senior citizens, narrating events their younger selves had participated in (one former lieutenant of the Pakistani army recounted his defection to the Bangladeshi side, and how the resulting death sentence awarded to him in court-martial has still not been rescinded; an Indian journalist spoke of finding himself under fire whilst climbing a hill only to realize it was coming from friendly Indian troops; retired soldiers from both countries described how country boats and cycle rickshaws had helped the advance of Indian forces in various theatres of war in Bangladesh; a former mukti joddha-turned-Bangladeshi army commander reminisced of how young Bangladeshis fought the Pakistani army with whatever they could lay their hands on, from bamboo stakes to antiquated 303 rifles; the anecdotes were as various as they were fascinating), one thing became apparent: from March 26, 1971, when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman formally declared Bangladesh free of Pakistani rule, a date celebrated as Bangladesh’s Independence Day, till December 16 of the same year, it was by no means certain to those engaged in the struggle for liberation that their efforts would, in fact, bear fruit, their dreams transform into reality. International opinion was not always favourable either: five days into the war, a December 8, 1971 headline in The New York Times reported the United Nations urging truce, by 104 votes to 11, and calling for the withdrawal of all troops from what was still officially East Pakistan to the rest of the world. Had the UN resolution been heeded, it is likely that the birth of Bangladesh would have been significantly delayed, leading to further bloodshed and genocide. Now, of course, we look upon the struggle and its outcome as something close to inevitable, and Bangladesh as a fait accompli even in 1971, but hindsight is always twenty-twenty., No such inevitability adheres to the three recent events I have listed above, nor is there anything inevitable about the way in which the current pandemic will play out; these are all, so to speak, works-in-progress. The tides of history have still not abated enough for us to be able to discern the forces that have created and shaped these phenomena, nor can we forecast how humanity will perceive them in a few years’ (or decades’) time. Commentators (this writer included) have made predictions on the effects of demonetization that have not been borne out by subsequent events; and both the anti-CAA and anti-farm-bills agitations are far from over — trying to gauge their outcomes now is as likely to be perceived as foolish as prescient by later chroniclers. We cannot even be sure of just how these events will be judged by the future. Will these three events become brief endnotes to the larger narrative of a world laid to waste by a deadly pandemic? Or will they be seen as defining events in the narrative of our nation? What will their relationship be interpreted as when considered in relation to the growing authoritarianism of this particular nation state? How will the protests be mapped against the many other events taking place in India and the world at this time — the significance of which may not even have registered with us thus far? These are well-nigh impossible questions to answer, and I am sure there are several others which we do not even know quite how to frame at this moment., In a 1963 speech to the overseas correspondents of the weekly, Newsweek, in London, Phil Graham, the publisher (and later co-owner) of The Washington Post, had spoken of the “inescapably impossible task of providing every week a first rough draft of history that will never really be completed about a world we can never really understand.” Despite the impossibility of making this first rough draft of history, and the perhaps ultimate incomprehensibility of the world in which we exist, we are all inextricably chained to the space-time matrix we were born into, and in which we live, love, grow, experience, and feel. All that we can do is strive to understand our times, and our selves, as best we can, even if we are doomed to fail in this task. Despite its seeming futility, we can, and we must, make an account of our lives and times, not so much for us, here and now, as for posterity; we have no option but to keep adding to the archive. The analysis and the interpretation of this archive remain a task for our descendants., The author is professor of Comparative Literature, Jadavpur University, and has been working as a volunteer for a rural development NGO for the last 30 years\n",

            "Mamata Banerjee - Mamata Banerjee renews pledge against citizen matrix - Telegraph India$ 17.12.20$Chief minister Mamata Banerjee repeated her pledge against the Narendra Modi government’s citizenship matrix on Wednesday to revive her support base in Cooch Behar — the district that shares border with Assam where the National Register of Citizens (NRC) had been published last year., “We will never allow the BJP to implement the NRC, CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) or the NPR (National Population Register) in Bengal. The BJP is playing divisive politics by using these tools and we will not let it happen,” Mamata told a public meeting at the Rashmela Ground here. , After the publication of the NRC in Assam, its repercussions were felt in districts like Cooch Behar and Alipurduar. Hundreds of families living in these districts had expressed concern over the future of their family members who stay in Assam and could not make it to the NRC., A senior leader here pointed out that there were hundreds of women from north Bengal districts, particularly Cooch Behar and Alipurduar, who got married in Assam. Also, there are others who have roots in these districts but stay in Assam., “Many of them could not find their names in the NRC and discontentment was brewing in their families. Mamata will try to use the issue to her advantage,” he said., Mamata and state leaders of Trinamul, sources said, also passed two directives to their colleagues in Cooch Behar., First, they have been asked to work together as infighting is one of the key issues in Cooch Behar that the state leadership found tough to handle. A section of party leaders feels presence of multiple lobbies in the party was one of the reasons for the BJP’s emergence as a force in the district., Second, the district leaders have been asked to be on alert to BJP functionaries from Assam who would be deputed in north bengal., At the meeting, Mamata also tried to woo Rajbanshi voters by bringing Bangshibadan Burman to the dais., Burman, a leader of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples’ Association —  that is believed to have clout in the community — also holds posts in the development &amp; cultural board and the language academy of Rajbanshis which were constituted by the state government., “We will support Trinamul in the Assembly elections next year. Mamata Banerjee has done a lot for us and north Bengal as a whole,” the Rajbanshi leader said in his speech., The chief minister also spoke about Nasya Sheikh— a Muslim community of the region. For the past few months, they have been demanding a development body. , “If we can form so many development boards….. we can also look into this demand,” said Mamata.\n",

            "Resignation - AGP leader, Pabindra Deka, quits, decries silence on CAA - Telegraph India$ 16.12.20$A founder member and legislator of the Asom Gana Parishad, Pabindra Deka, resigned from the party on Tuesday claiming the AGP had not only lost its regional character, which was “exposed by its silence on the Citizenship Amendment Act, but was also “completely” under the control of the BJP., Deka, a three-time MLA from Patacharkuchi in lower Assam, former AASU president and minister told The Telegraph that he had no option but to leave the AGP, an offshoot of the Assam Agitation against illegal foreigners, because the party has “given up” its responsibility towards the people, economy or politics and is now run by a “small group” only interested in becoming ministers., “Being associated with regionalism since my student days, I had openly opposed the CAA but the party sidelined me. I was the vice-president but they ignored me in the new committee set up recently. They say they are against CAA and that they have challenged it legally. But at the same time they are still with the BJP and are ministers in the BJP-led government. Didn’t the BJP-led Centre impose the law despite widespread protests in the state? The AGP voted in favour of the CAA in Parliament even though the party had decided to oppose it. They are silent now. It stands exposed. I had no option but to leave,” Deka said., The CAA makes it easier for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to acquire Indian citizenship, which is seen by most in Assam as a threat to the state’s identity and culture. The second phase of agitation against the law has resumed and is likely to intensify before the Assembly polls., “The AGP is under the BJP’s control. They are talking about contesting from seats won by the AGP in 2016. I foresee the AGP suffering the same fate as the Bodoland People’s Front as it grows in strength. The AGP workers and leaders at the grassroots are unhappy with the prevailing state of affairs under the present leadership which has now even started being sarcastic about student protests, forgetting the party is a product of the AASU-spearheaded Assam Agitation. They have apparently given up on the promise of protecting jati (community), mati (land), bheti (hearth) of Assam,” Deka said., BPF is an ally of the BJP in the state government but the ruling party not only contested the BTC polls alone but launched a bitter campaign against them. Though the BPF managed emerged as the single largest party in the BTC polls and fell short by four seats to form the council, the BJP did not help it and instead tied up with its rivals, the United People’s Party Liberal and the Gana Suraksha Party, to form the council on Tuesday., After announcing his resignation, Deka left for Sivasagar where the Assam Jatiya Parishad, a new regional party backed by the All Assam Students Union and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, is holding its two-day debut convention. He is expected to join the new party. Former AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi will be joining the party on Wednesday. Sources said Gogoi may be handed a key position in the new party., AGP insiders said Deka’s departure should not be seen in isolation and that “at least four-five” AGP legislators are on the verge of quitting since the top brass are more concerned about their friendship with the BJP than the “promise” made to the people and its bounden duty to strengthen the party., “The AGP, Congress, and to some extent the AIUDF, will see a lot of churning before the polls because the new parties, especially Raijor Dal and Assam Jatiya Parishad, may offer a choice to aspiring candidates, ticket-seekers and voters. The Congress needs to go back to the boardroom if it wants to remain in the contest,” a political observer said., AGP spokesperson Manoj Saikia said that Deka was planning to leave because his chances of winning in the next polls was very thin. “His position is not good. That is why he left,” he said., Saikia also said the AGP is against the CAA and is fighting it legally since it has already become a law. “We are opposed to it, let there be no doubt. Moreover, we are an ally of the BJP. We have not joined the BJP. We are working in the field to strengthen the party before the polls. We will do well,” he added.\n",

            "Police brutality - Year after, Jamia student struggles to cross road  - Telegraph India$ 15.12.20$Mohammad Minhajuddin struggles to cross the road as he heads to the civil court where he practises., Rush-hour in Samastipur, Bihar, is nowhere close to even Sunday traffic in Delhi. But Minhajuddin’s field of vision is half what it was when he was a student in the capital. The 27-year-old also struggles to estimate the speed of an approaching car., His right eye tears up if he goes through legal documents on his laptop or mobile screen for too long., Minhajuddin says a police baton claimed his left eye on December 15 last year when Delhi’s law-keepers went on the rampage at Jamia Millia Islamia university, where he studied. Ostensibly, the cops were looking for violent protesters against the new citizenship regime who had allegedly torched vehicles., The boots and canes left a trail of destruction through the varsity libraries and even a place of worship, causing Rs 2.66 crore worth of damage., Minhajuddin, then doing his master’s in law, is among the students and security guards the police thrashed. He says a CRPF man hit him with a fibreglass baton as he was fleeing a reading room that stick-wielding cops had barged into, shortly after the building had been shelled with tear smoke., “Every day is a struggle. I need help to cross a road. I collide into people when I try to move fast through the crowded court premises,” he told The Telegraph., “Delhi High Court has clubbed several petitions for compensation, including mine, and is still hearing the case. We were refused even interim compensation despite a recommendation from the National Human Rights Commission (that the Delhi government compensate the injured students).”, The assault has forced Minhajuddin to drop his plans to earn a PhD and practise in Delhi’s courts., The only compensation he has received so far is a cheque for Rs 5 lakh from the Delhi Wakf Board. Doctors were able to save his right eye but have ruled out an eye transplant on the left side because of nerve damage., Minhajuddin has already spent Rs 1 lakh on treatment and needs to regularly consult an ophthalmologist., “Initially, several people and NGOs promised help. Their enthusiasm lasted only a short while. Ultimately nothing came (apart from the wakf board’s assistance),” he said., “I have learnt to be patient and not depend on politicians, to be self-reliant.”, Chandan Kumar, 22, who earned a BA in mass media from Jamia this year, was taken to hospital in the same ambulance with Minhajuddin., Kumar received five stitches on his head for injuries from alleged caning by policemen who had found him in the library toilet. He had hid there after the tear-smoke shelling., “This whole year has been a nightmare that never ends. I have recurring dreams of the police attacking us,” he said., Kumar, set to begin an MA course in linguistics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said he wanted punishment for the errant cops rather than compensation for himself., “Fascism came alive from a concept I had read in books to something that we as students had to endure because we were studying in a minority institution,” he said., “In my court petition, I did not seek compensation. For me, justice will be served only if the officers guilty of attacking us are punished. I’m yet to see (signs of) that happening in court so far.”, Kumar, an activist of the CPIML Liberation’s All India Students Association, was named in an FIR on the Jamia violence but has not been named in the chargesheets., Two of his mobile phones have been seized, one after the other, during the four sessions of interrogation. The police have questioned him over the Jamia violence and the protests against the new citizenship regime that the force blames for the February riots that killed 53 people., The women-led agitation at Shaheen Bagh began as a reaction to the Jamia brutality., Asif Iqbal Tanha of the Students Islamic Organisation — another Jamia student-activist named in the FIR with Kumar — is in jail, waiting to be tried for his alleged role in inciting the February violence through his participation in the citizenship protests., “The result of our protest, and others that followed, is that finally, today, the government which never listened to anyone has been compelled to talk to the farmers,” Kumar said. “The protests by students, doctors and farmers have helped sustain at least a nominal democracy. Despite (the government’s supporters) calling the farmers Khalistanis who eat foreign-funded pizzas, the farmers cannot be delegitimised like we students were.”, A photograph of women students shielding a man from the police’s batons at the protest march that preceded the rampage became a symbol of the resilience of the students, who continued to participate in the anti-citizenship-act protests. Aysha Renna N, an MA (modern history) student, was one of the women in the photo., “I was trolled online. Details of my family, my social media posts and my studies were made public,” she told this newspaper., “I was also criticised so much for the politics I spoke about, for asserting my identity, for praising Allah before my speeches, or wearing a scarf, that it made me more stern in my politics.”, Her Facebook profile was blocked, and she moved to Twitter., “Every time I recall that incident (of the protest march in which she was hit by the police), it is traumatic and painful. But it also became an inspiration for a pan-India anti-CAA movement… and to speak out against the anti-national activities of the BJP government,” she said., Jamia has not claimed damages from the Centre, to which the Delhi police report. The university had to move court after the police refused to register an FIR on its complaint of a rampage., “We have not received anything from the court,” vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar told this newspaper. “Whatever comes your way, you have to find a way out and we have successfully done it.”, In June news came that Jamia had made it to the top ten in a national-level ranking of universities., Besides, 14 of its teachers figure on an internationally peer-reviewed list of top scientists.\n",

BJP sources said the cancellation of the visit suggested that the Centre was not yet ready to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act, a major demand of the Matuas., Instead of Thakurnagar in the Bongaon Lok Sabha constituency, Shah will go to West Midnapore on the Day 1 of his Bengal tour from December 19., “Amitji is coming (to Bengal) as scheduled but the plan to visit Thakurnagar has been changed. He will visit West Midnapore to take stock of the party’s organisation in the Midnapore zone,” said state BJP vice-president Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, who is also the in-charge of the party’s Nabadwip zone, under which the Bongaon parliamentary constituency falls., “Amitji will visit the Nabadwip zone later,” he added., Although Roy Chowdhury didn’t elaborate on the replacement of Thakurnagar with East Midnapore, multiple sources in the BJP said the sudden change in Shah’s itinerary was significant., Several BJP leaders, including state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu, had earlier said Shah would visit Thakurnagar to address the concerns of the Matuas as discontent was brewing in the community over the delay in the implementation of the CAA., BJP’s Bengal minder and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had visited Thakurnagar last week and met local party MP Santanu Thakur to draw up the details of Shah’s programme amid a buzz in the saffron camp that the Union home minister would make some announcements on the implementation of the CAA during his coming tour., “It seems the Centre is not yet ready to implement the CAA and hence, Amitji is not visiting Thakurnagar,” a source in the BJP said while adding that the plan to drop Thakurnagar from Shah’s itinerary would hurt the party., “The Matuas are already unhappy with us over the delay in framing of the CAA rules. Sensing an opportunity to woo the Matuas back, Mamata Banerjee had recently visited Bongaon and met representatives of the community,” said a BJP insider., A section of the Matua Mahasangha has held Santanu Thakur responsible for the change in Shah’s plan. “The MP is not protecting the interests of the community,” said a Matua leader., The grumbling in the community over the cancellation of Shah’s visit prompted Prasenjit Bose, convenor of Joint Forum Against NRC, to remind Matua leaders that the citizenship issue was being dangled before them only as a carrot. “The Matua leadership must understand that the BJP is only using them as a vote box,” said Bose, whose organisation held several meetings with the Matua leadership on the citizenship issue., Shah’s plan to visit Midnapore has also led to speculation in the BJP about the possible reason. “There is a rumour that some senior Trinamul leaders in the Midnapore region will join the BJP during Amitji’s visit,” a source said., However, MP and state BJP general secretary Jyotirmoy Singh Mahato, who held a preparatory meeting with party workers at Kharagpore in East Midnapore on Monday over Shah’s visit, rejected all speculations., “Both Thakurnagar and Midnapore were options in hand and we zeroed in on the latter,” Mahato said. “Amitji will visit freedom fighter Khudiram Bose’s house here (in Midnapore) and will have lunch at a farmer’s house. He will also meet BJP workers on December 19.”, Sources said offices were being set up for each leader in charge of five BJP organisational zones in Bengal., “These leaders will stay in the respective zones they have been assigned till the Assembly elections are over and hence, they will need work space,” said a BJP leader., Sunil Bansal, the general secretary (organisation) of Uttar Pradesh, who oversees the Calcutta zone will have his office at the state BJP headquarters at 6 Muralidhar Sen Lane in the city. Pawan Rana, Bhikhubhai Dalsaniya and Ravinder Raju will have their offices in Midnapore, Nabadweep and Burdwan zones, respectively. Ratnakar, the joint general secretary (organisation) of Bihar, will have his office in the north Bengal zone.\n",

We have reiterated these points to Kalashji,” Santanu told the media after the meeting., Sources in the BJP said Vijayvargiya went all the way to Thakurnagar to meet the Mahasangh leaders and Thakur as the party was worried over the restlessness of Matuas over the delay in implementing the citizenship law., Speaking to the reporters, Vijayvargiya refuted claims that Thakur was annoyed with the party leadership about the delay. “He is a BJP MP and held a meeting with the home minister a few days ago. The CAA will be implemented by January or February next year,” he said., Vijayvargiya arrived at Thakurnagar around 1pm and held talks with leaders of the Matua Mahasangh and lunched with them before leaving., The visit of BJP’s Bengal minder to Thakurnagar also comes close on the heels of Mamata Banerjee’s December 9 rally in Gopalnagar where the chief minister announced that Matuas were Indian citizens and did not need CAA. She also vouched not to allow implementation of the CAA in the state, while announcing a slew of measures to win over the Matuas., The sudden move of Mamata has left the BJP jittery as the Matuas had largely been Trinamul supporters since the change of guard in Bengal, but the BJP had since managed to make solid inroads in the community by playing the citizenship card. , To counter Mamata’s renewed effort to woo Matuas and her staunch opposition to the citizenship law, the BJP wants to use Shah’s visit as the votes of the Namashudra community would decide winners on quite a few seats in next year's Assembly polls., A source in the Mahasangh said one more reason for Vijayvargiya’s visit to Thakurnagar was to personally convince Santanu that the law would eventually be implemented. The source added that even after Saturday’s meeting Subrata doesn’t appear to be convinced., “We have learnt that the Centre is planning to implement the Citizenship Act very soon. But we will be happy if Amit Shahji visits Thakurnagar by January and makes an announcement about its implementation from here,” Santanu said., BJP insiders said efforts were on to ensure that Shah visited Thakurbari to make the announcement as it was crucial to win the support of the Matuas largely spread over North 24-Parganas and Nadia and a few districts in north and south Bengal.\n",

Around 18 people were injured., Saturday’s protest rallies, meetings and shraddhanjali across the state come a day after black day was organised under the banner of the North East Students’ Organisation (NESO) to protest against the CAA that had slowed down because of the pandemic., The revival of the protests, sources said, may not see huge participation like last year but will be “effective enough” to keep it in the limelight and the BJP-led government on its toes as the state gets into the election mode. The state Assembly polls are scheduled for early next year., “One of the highlights of the day was a gathering of people at the Guwahati Rotary Club in response to a social media message by conscious citizens in the evening. They lit candles in the memory of the martyrs, raised slogans against the CAA and sang a few protest songs but were not allowed to take out a torchlight rally by police whose numbers were clearly more than the participants,\" said Bidisha Barman, one of the participants., AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya told that the government has not instituted a probe into the deaths even after a year. “The government knows who are the killers and this is why we want a probe by a sitting high court judge. We will also continue our peaceful movement till the law is repealed,” he said., The CCACAA, which offered Rs 10,000 each to families of the martyrs, gave a call to all the organisations and collectives for a united fight against the legislation keeping aside their differences., Deben Tamuly of the CCACC said they have renewed their pledge to fight against the CAA and sought a probe into the deaths of the martyrs. Senior Left leader Hemen Das and Rajya Sabha MP Ajit Kumar Bhuyan flayed the BJP-led Centre for imposing the CAA., “We have also demanded a judicial probe into the deaths of martyrs and the release of CAA detainees such as Akhil Gogoi and Debangana Kalita,” Tamuly said.\n",

The forum said on Saturday that its supporters were ready to start protests the moment the BJP-led Centre started implementing the act., “The act came into being exactly a year ago, which led to nationwide protests. If the Narendra Modi government issues a gazette notification to implement the act, we will again hit the streets to prevent its implementation,” said forum convener Prasenjit Bose., “The BJP is gearing up with its politics of communal polarisation as polls are nearing. This is why their leaders are talking about the CAA again,” Bose said, adding these comments prompted them to prepare for protests again., Union home minister Amit Shah’s proposed visit to Bongaon on December 19 was a part of the BJP’s plan to fuel pro-CAA sentiments and polarise Bengal voters, he added., Bongaon and Ranaghat Lok Sabha constituencies, both currently represented by the BJP, are dominated by the Matua community. Some members of the community have problems with citizenship, and the BJP is trying to woo them with the new citizenship matrix.

It is, after all, a question of my identity and my country,” Fatima added.\n",

            "National Register of Citizens (NRC) - A year on, anti-CAA cry unmuted - Telegraph India$ 12.12.20$Close to 1,000 people protested against the Centre’s citizenship matrix in the heart of the city on Friday, shattering a long lull triggered by the Covid pandemic., Deafening roars of azaadi and “we will not show papers” posters made a comeback on busy roads as the protesters marched from Moulali to Esplanade where they staged a meeting. Many of the marchers had come from the districts, like Nadia and Murshidabad. Some of them reached Calcutta last night., December 11 was chosen because the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by Parliament on the same day last year. The campaign against the citizenship troika — National Register of Citizens, National Population Register and CAA — was at its peak when the coronavirus brought everything to a grinding halt., The rally was organised by Anti-NRC People’s Movement, a joint platform of 21 organisations campaigning against the citizenship thrust. Groups of people started arriving at the meeting point — Ram Leela ground on CIT Road in Moulali — on foot, mini vans and buses., A mini-truck parked on the road became a makeshift stage for speakers., “The Narendra Modi-led government has used the pandemic and lockdown as a tool to stifle dissent and bring another series of anti-people laws like the labour code and farm bills. The government had kept the NRC-NPR-CAA combine in the cupboard like mothballed woollens but they would bring it out any time. We should be alert,” said Prasun Chatterjee of Azaad Gana Morcha., The BJP’s Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya said on Sunday that the Centre might implement the CAA from next month to confer citizenship on a large section of refugees living in Bengal., “From infiltrators to termites, we remember every word that was used to describe us, citizens of this country,” said Kasturi Basu of Humans of Patuli., A group of youngsters from Janaganamana Sanskritik Manch performed a series of songs — most of them tweaks of popular Bengali songs. “Batashe bohichhe bish, bukete lagilo chot, raja je kohilo heshe NRC eshe gechhe (The air is filled with poison, the heart wounded. The king says smilingly that NRC is here),” said one song., The opening lines of another song: “Tora je ja bolish bhai, raja’r shosta mojur chai (No matter what you say, the king wants cheap labour).”, Almost every speaker said the citizenship thrust mirrored blatant religious discrimination and its main objective was creating a vast pool of cheap labourers for big companies., “This government has sold itself to big corporate houses and will turn people languishing in detention camps into cheap labourers,” said Chandan Bhattacharjee of the Sramik-Krishak Ekta Manch, who had come from Jaynagar in South 24-Parganas., The rally started from Ramlila Maidan in Moulali around 2.30pm and its head reached the front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters on SN Banerjee Road around 4pm., Tricolours and large banners fluttered under the canopy of trees dotting the road that connects Moulali with Esplanade. A third of the marchers were women, who often out-shouted the men in sloganeering., “System error… Not found — Hindurashtra,” read one poster. “We want rights, not riots,” read another., A police officer put the number of marchers at over 500 but organisers said more than 1,000 people had turned up. “It is a big number because many people, even in Calcutta, are still not ready to join a large group for fear of the virus,” an organiser said., Many marchers on Friday had posters of political prisoners like Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Varavara Rao. The protesters demanded their “immediate release”., Banojyotsna Lahiri, a Presidency and JNU alumna and a friend of Khalid, walked in the rally on Friday., “In Delhi, a protest march is usually limited to the stretch between Mandi House and Jantar Mantar. It is extremely tough to protest anywhere else. Being able to walk in a rally through a residential area like this is a big deal. With people watching from their balconies and shopkeepers coming outside stores, the protest becomes so organic,” she said., Arup Majumdar, the convener of the Anti-NRC People’s Movement, said a section of people opposed to the citizenship matrix were now more bothered with livelihood problems posed by the pandemic. “Since there is no strong narrative on the part of the government right now, they think the NRC-NPR-CAA is not on Modi-Shah’s immediate agenda. But the BJP will suddenly strike with these tools, maybe just before the Bengal election. If we do not step up the vigil now, we cannot do much then,” said Majumdar.\n",

            "supreme-court-of-india - Neither scared, nor silent: An explosion of outrage  - Telegraph India$ 15.08.20$If the Supreme Court decision to hold lawyer Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt for two tweets was meant to have a chilling effect and scare people in general and lawyers in particular into silence, it drew the exact opposite response on Friday., The floodgates burst open. Within hours, the two tweets that had offended the court — one on the Chief Justice posing on a Harley-Davidson and the other on the role of the judiciary in the past six years — were dug out and re-posted by many not just in support of Bhushan but in a show of defiance., As in the protests against the citizenship law, it was not the political class but the ordinary citizen who took the lead in voicing outrage at a judgment that many saw as an attempt by the apex court of the land to place itself above scrutiny. Many of these ordinary citizens were lawyers who are well aware of the risks they run in confronting the Supreme Court, but as one of them put it: “This is an attack on all lawyers.”, The irony of the verdict coming on the eve of Independence Day wasn’t lost on people either. Historian S. Irfan Habib tweeted: “…I don’t think even the British ever punished dissenting or even critical voices of lawyers, poets, writers and intellectuals this way.” Another historian, Ramachandra Guha, said: “Through this act, the Supreme Court has let itself down, and has let the Republic down too. A dark day for Indian democracy.”, Salman Anees Soz, son of former Union minister Saifuddin Soz, brought up the Supreme Court’s recent decision to dismiss a case against his father’s year-long house arrest because the Centre said he was not in detention. “The Supreme Court of India finds a citizen’s criticism contemptible but remains silent when the government brazenly lies to it. As a citizen, I find this situation contemptible,” he tweeted., Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi waded in with a reminder: “When talking of contempt, can we forget that the criminal contempt case regarding Babri Masjid has been pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court for nearly 28 years?”, Pune-based political scientist Suhas Palshikar said: “One may not agree with everything said in a tweet but that surely doesn’t deserve a 105-page essay resulting in a pronouncement of ‘guilty of contempt’.”But the BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya pulled out an old tweet of Bhushan’s where he had favoured contempt proceedings against a judge and gave the lawyer’s critics — he has many on both sides of the political divide — something to talk about., The general mood though could be summed up in two tweets. One simply posted an old Hindi film song: “Jo tumko ho pasand, wahi baat kahenge. Tum din ko agar raat kaho, raat kahenge. I will say only what you want to hear. If you say it is night when it is day, I will say it is night.”, Another quoted Shakespeare: “And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.”\n",

I always believed in the unity and diversity of India as a country. But the condition of the minorities is pathetic and it’s getting worse day by day. I am looking forward to an India in which everyone should be able to live by asserting their identity and believe in  an India which is inclusive of all different ideologies. Though I don’t have hope in this government I have hopes in the citizens of this country., She used the traditional kolam to protest against the CAA , The main thing I learnt about the state is how vicious it can become.  The kind of harassment we faced only reminded us of what we are fighting for and against whom. Our futures are at stake, our values are on trial. I am confident we will win. But the only sad part is that our fight is no longer only with the government, it’s with the hate mindset of our societies., She wore an abaya and hijab and held a placard that read: “Mr Modi, I am Indulekha, identify me by my dress?”, The secular foundations of India are currently under tremendous stress. Contemporary India, as many would argue, looks more saffron in its ideological makeup than at any other point since Independence. Let us hope for a future when the Chakra will lead our nation, and not the Saffron, White or Green., Creative producer who juggled her job and multiple protests in Mumbai, where she also distributed food and water, I did not follow politics until 2014, and last December was the first time I took part in any public demonstration... I learnt that I liked being a part of a movement bigger than myself. I learnt that I could be passionate and driven. I just needed to find in life where to direct that passion and drive — and for a brief moment, that was directed towards the protests and the demand for  change…. We need to peacefully demand the kind of change that we deserve., Hailing from Bathinda, he volunteered at the langar at Shaheen Bagh, I can’t say that things will get any better now. Look at Safoora Zargar (a pregnant student who spent more than two months in jail)… The people of India must think about whether this new nationalism the government is talking about will fill our stomachs or get us better education or hospitals.  All I know is that it is those who struggle that are remembered and not those who grow old in anonymity by not doing anything for the country., She was at the forefront of the women-led vigil against the citizenship thrust at Park Circus Maidan, I learnt that I was seriously unaware about my country and my inner potential. I loved the discovery of the secular ethos of my country and my countrymen from the way they came out on the streets to protest against the CAA-NPR-NRC. It was sacred because they were on the streets for one of the basic rights — ‘right to life’. The rage, the logic and the confidence of the protesters also made me realise things about myself. I learned that I could be on the streets for days and can withstand the cold night without any roof. In the wake of the Covid-19 curbs, me and some like-minded people have been running a digital campaign against the CAA-NPR-NRC. We face non-stop trolling but the days of struggle on the streets have instilled courage in us. We are not scared. We know that we can give a tough competition to anyone in power because we, the people, are the real authority., The principal of Bishop’s College, Caleb was at many a rally Calcuttasaw against the new citizenship regime, The past year has made me feel fearful of whether my rights as a person following a minority faith in this country will be respected. It has also been a year where one has watched with despair the growth of majoritarianism at the expense of true democracy and human rights (Kashmir comes immediately to mind). I feel we have gone backwards in many ways and it will only take a long and sustained struggle to recover the secular and democratic way of life that once we Indians enjoyed., Part of the anti-CAA protests in Chennai, I have learnt to judge this country not by the actions of violent and hateful people, but by the vast majority that toils and gets by while maintaining their dignity against great odds. The government, I realise, has become a disaster that ordinary people have to confront and manage. I am certainly hopeful. India has survived much hate, and while there are many that would like to kill the idea of India with their hate, there are far more that live the idea of an inclusive India.\n",

            "hindutva - 73 years of Indian Independence: How the ‘India Story’ ended - Telegraph India$ 15.08.20$On the 15th of August 2007 — the sixtieth anniversary of Indian Independence — I published an article in the Hindustan Times about how our country was doing. At that stage, there was much talk about India being an emerging superpower. China had already made its mark on the international stage; and it was apparently now our turn. The 21st century was to be an Asian Century, where the rest of the world would watch with wonder and admiration while China and India dominated the spheres of economics and politics much as the United States of America had in the 20th century and Great Britain had in the 19th century., These exultant anticipations of our imminent global greatness had two principal sets of cheerleaders: entrepreneurs in Mumbai and Bangalore and editors in New Delhi. The previous year, these groups had pooled their energies into hosting a splendid show at the World Economic Forum in Davos which boasted of India being the “World’s Fastest Growing Democracy”. The last word of this tagline was a sly dig at China; it signalled to American and European firms that their employees would find India a much more congenial place to live and work in while, at the same time, getting a handsome return on their investment as well. , Entrepreneurs are by temperament optimistic, even utopian. On the other hand, historians are by temperament sceptical, even cynical. Drawing on this professional DNA, my article in the Hindustan Times on 15th August 2007 argued that our ambitions to dominate the world were unrealistic. There remained deep fault lines of caste, class and religion; our institutions were not quite as robust as the framers of the Constitution had imagined them to be, while widespread environmental degradation posed serious questions about the sustainability of economic development. The tale being told at Davos and beyond did not really reflect these realities on the ground. Our country was not, I concluded, about to become a superpower; rather, India “would muddle along in the middle, as it always had”., I knew that my entrepreneur friends would find my assessment dismayingly pessimistic. They did, at the time; but looking back at what I wrote thirteen years ago to the day, it seems I was, in fact, excessively optimistic. In the years prior to the 60th anniversary of Indian Independence, the economy was growing at a robust 8 per cent per annum. Before the pandemic began, it had already plummeted to 4 per cent per annum; and now it shall be resoundingly in the negative., Whatever the truth of the claim made in 2006 and 2007, for some years now we have not been the ‘world’s fastest growing democracy’. Moreover, the last word in that tagline also looks increasingly suspect now. Our economy no longer grows fast; and one cannot really describe India as a functioning democracy any more. I have in earlier columns described the systematic capture of public institutions by the party in power. Our civil service, our investigative agencies, the army, the Reserve Bank of India, the Election Commission, even to some extent the judiciary, are increasingly seen as partisan, acting on orders from the politicians who control them. The secretive electoral bonds have further vitiated the integrity of the democratic process; as have the buying and selling of legislators in different state assemblies. Meanwhile, large sections of the media have capitulated to Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party; the small part that remains brave and independent-minded is subject to intense harassment by the State. , I once poked fun at those who, back in 2007, spoke grandly of India’s superpower ambitions. Truth be told, at the time I was a cheerleader for India itself. Not for its economy, but for other things. I had praised India’s democracy, cautiously; and its cultural and religious pluralism, exuberantly. That India then had a Sikh prime minister who had been sworn in by a Muslim president, that our currency notes carried their denomination in seventeen different languages, indeed seventeen different scripts — all this seemed to me an emphatic vindication of the ideals of the founders of the Republic. , In retrospect, the electoral defeat of the BJP in 2004 and then again in 2009 made liberals like myself complacent about the future of Hindutva. For despite those defeats, Hindutva had not diminished either as a political force or as a powerful, and powerfully malign, idea. Powered by the charismatic personality of Modi, the BJP won a majority in the elections of 2014. Modi’s first term as prime minister will be chiefly remembered for the disastrous experiment with demonetization that set back the Indian economy by many years. The first year of his second term as prime minister will be remembered for the abolition of Article 370 and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which together delivered a body blow to Indian pluralism. What other havoc Modi and his government may cause to our economy and our society in the years to follow remains to be seen., Back in August 2007, it was premature perhaps to speak of India as an emerging superpower. But there was nonetheless an ‘India Story’ of sorts; of a large, complex, heterogeneous territory that had somehow made itself into a single, unified nation-state; of a patriarchal and not-very-literate society that had somehow managed to successfully organize many iterations of the largest exercise of the democratic franchise in the history of the world; of a land scarred for centuries by famine and deprivation that had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty while forging ahead in cutting-edge sectors such as information technology and biotechnology. , Back in August 2007, crude boosterism and anticipations of global greatness were unwarranted; but a quiet, understated pride in our not insubstantial achievements since Independence perhaps was not. Now, in August 2020, there is no ‘India Story’ of any sort any more. Even before Covid-19 hit our shores, our economy was in a shambles. Our democracy was widely seen as corrupt and corroded. Our minorities were frightened and insecure. Even the entrepreneurs I know, who were once so hopeful and optimistic, were pervaded by a sense of doom and gloom. And now the pandemic has come along to further intensify our economic woes, our social cleavages, and our democratic deficits. It will take years to set the economy back on track; and whether the institutional fabric of our democracy and the pluralistic ethos of our society can ever recover from the damage done to them since 2014 is an open question., It is for future historians to fully and authoritatively document how our slide as a nation began, and to critically assess which individuals and institutions were responsible, and in what ways, for this decline. My own view is that the seeds of our fall were sown during the second term of Manmohan Singh, although the real damage has been done since Modi became prime minister. But what is not in dispute is this. On the sixtieth anniversary of Indian Independence, 15th August 2007, one could at least debate whether our country was a superpower in the making. Now, thirteen years later, such a debate would be farcical in the extreme., ramachandraguha@yahoo.in\n",

The six of them came out of a car, in violation of the ongoing Covid lockdown, beer bottles in hand. When he tried to defend himself against the verbal abuse, they “became aggressive and used unparliamentary language”. In his FIR, Zubeen also sought an inquiry into the incident., One of the youths involved in the incident is said to be the NSUI’s city unit vice-president Hirakjyoti Rajbongshi. Assam PCC president Ripun Bora told The Telegraph on Thursday that Rajbongshi has been suspended since his name came up during the investigation. “We cannot support such acts and want all the guilty to be punished,” Bora said., The verbal assault against Zubeen, who also has several Bollywood hits, including Ya Ali (Gangster) and Dil tu hi batta (Krrish 3), comes less than a week of the agriculture department announcing plans to make him a brand ambassador because as a youth icon he could attract the younger generation towards agri and allied activities., The move had triggered a backlash on social media because he was seen as “giving up” on a cause he had led from the front for months before the anti-CAA movement turned violent in December., Rajya Sabha MP Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, another leading anti-CAA face, was among those who criticised Zubeen for his growing proximity to the BJP-led government which supports the CAA, which many in the state see as a threat to the culture and identity of the state., When contacted, Zubeen’s wife, Garima Garg, a fashion designer, said he has not accepted any offer. “We met the agriculture department people because Zubeen wanted to do something for the agriculture sector but he has not accepted any brand ambassador offer. He is very upset with last night’s development,” she said., An aide of Zubeen told the media that although there was no physical assault on him, the youths taunted him with “letting Assam down” and for getting close to the ruling BJP., Support from Zubeen came from the government, the Opposition and AASU., Condemning the incident, government spokesperson Himanta Biswa Sarma said, “I don’t want to see Zubeen in the BJP or the Congress or in the government. Zubeen should concentrate on protecting the culture of Assam and earn laurels for the state. Let us keep him away from controversies and politics. Let Zubeen stay as Zubeen. We all have to protect Zubeen.”, Senior Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP, Pradyut Bordoloi, said Zubeen is “an emotional person but his intentions are honourable. If he has approached the government to do something for Assam, there is nothing wrong in it,” Bordoloi said., AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi, too, condemned the “attack on Zubeenda”.\n",

Twelve persons (referring to members of the Clause 6 committee) cannot take a call. It has made its recommendations but the final call will be that of the Assembly. After the recommendations have been discussed, debated and ratified by the Assembly, the Centre will act on its implementation. The Centre cannot act on its own,” cabinet minister and government spokesperson Himanta Biswa Sarma said., The All Assam Students’ Union, a signatory to the Assam Accord, had on Tuesday made public the Clause 6 committee report because the Centre was “sitting on it”., Clause 6 provides for constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards “to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.”, The committee had defined an Assamese as anyone who was living in the state from before January 1, 1951., Taking a dig at the “political” AASU, Sarma said a mechanism has to be devised to identify who were residing in the state before 1951. “Will we need to prepare a new register of 1951 population? What will happen to people who don’t have papers but have been there from before 1951?” he said., AASU president Dipanka Nath said finding people from 1951 would not be a problem because the government has already digitised the 1951 National Register of Citizens., Sarma said it would be better to leave the decisions to the next state Assembly members because “we are at the fag end of our tenure”. “We need to tread cautiously. The Clause 6 committee has given us two years’ time for the implementation of the recommendations. The committee has also said some of the recommendations are complex and need to be examined by a three-member committee. But I want to assure everyone that the government is committed to implementing Clause 6 recommendations,” Sarma said., Election to the 126-member Assembly is likely in 2021 April-May. The next Assembly session is on August 31., The day also saw two senior Congress leaders — former chief minister Tarun Gogoi and CLP leader Debabrata Saikia — hitting out at the BJP-led governments for not being sincere in implementing the Clause 6 committee report. Gogoi said the member-secretary of the committee, Satyendra Garg, a senior official of the Union home ministry, had not signed the report. “How can they implement Clause 6 without withdrawing the Citizenship Amendment Act? These are contradictory. It is another jumla of the BJP,” Gogoi said., Saikia said his observation last year that the BJP was “never sincere” about implementing Clause 6 has come true with AASU making public the committee’s report.\n",

Bobde posing on a Harley Davidson motorbike and another alleging that democracy had been destroyed in the country during the last six years under the last four Chief Justices., In an application moved through advocate Kamini Jaiswal, Bhushan also said that a lawyer’s complaint on the basis of which the Supreme Court had issued the suo motu contempt notice mentioned only the June 29 Harley Davidson tweet. Bhushan contended that when the court issued the notice almost a month later on July 22 and heard the matter, it also mentioned the June 27 tweet on democracy. The contempt notice had, referred to a newspaper report that had “mysteriously” appeared the same day on the democracy tweet, Bhushan pointed out., Bhushan had in his preliminary reply justified the tweets saying it was his “bona fide impressions” and had sought to draw the inference that the Supreme Court had not dealt fairly with matters relating to the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute, the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, electoral bonds issued by the Modi government, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and a host of other issues linked to the fundamental rights., He had said in his affidavit that the Supreme Court had “largely failed in its duty to protect these and thus failed to prevent the subversion of our democracy”., In his application filed on Thursday, Bhushan has requested the court that in case it is not satisfied with his preliminary reply and wishes to proceed further, he should be allowed to provide further evidence under Section 17(5) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. He has also pleaded for a copy of the complaint of advocate Mehak Maheshwari that forms the basis of the contempt case., Bhushan has cited the apex court ruling in the 2019 Vijay Kurle case wherein it had held that a contemnor is entitled to all materials on the basis of which he or she is sought to be prosecuted for contempt., He has also pleaded that the proceedings on the suo motu notice issued to him with respect to the June 27 tweet on democracy be placed before the Chief Justice of India for allocation to another bench, essentially seeking that the two tweets be dealt with separately., Bhushan’s case is before the bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Bhushan Gavai and Krishna Murari. Justice Mishra is set to retire next month., “The Hon’ble Court converted Mr Maheswari’s petition which was only as regards the Harley Davidson tweet dated 29.06.2020 into a suo motu petition.

The hashtags #AssamAgainstEIA, #WithdrawDraftEIA2020 and #EIA2020 were successful in rising to all-India trend No. 2, 4 and 22 respectively,” the AASA said., The “enormous positive response” has made the association hopeful of achieving its objective of getting the draft EIA scrapped., AASA president Subhrajyoti Duarah and general secretary Mrigen Jyoti Kashyap said the online protest received active support from the All Assam Students’ Union chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya, president Dipanka Nath and general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi. The AASU, too, wants the draft scrapped., The Telegraph had reported last week that the draft EIA is set to emerge as the new flashpoint, after the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), between the Centre and the Northeast. The campaign against the draft is likely to intensify ahead of the August 11 deadline to file suggestions on and objections to the draft before the environment ministry, which had published the draft on March 3., The EIA is a process under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, preventing industrial and infrastructure projects from being approved without proper evaluation and scrutiny., This process is essential for ensuring every project passes through the rigours of the EIA process prior to the grant of an environmental clearance., However, most in the Northeast view it as a “design” to exploit the region’s natural resources by taking away the democratic right of the local people to protest or to be heard., AASA said the draft EIA proposed to “strengthen” the government’s discretionary powers while “limiting” the engagement of people in protecting the environment., AASU general secretary Gogoi tweeted that the draft EIA impact would be disastrous for the Northeast. He urged the masses to support the AASA endeavour to mobilise opinion against the draft and told this newspaper that both online and street protests would continue till the draft is scrapped., Bhattacharjya tweeted that implementation of the “anti-democratic &amp; anti-environment” draft would have a “ruinous effect on Assam, alongside the Northeast’s repository of rich resources”., Bhattadev University, Tezpur University, Cotton University, Gauhati University, Dibrugarh University, Madhavdev University, Assam Women’s University, Darrang College, Nawgong College, D.R. College, Kaliabor College, TISS Guwahati, Fridays For Future, Guwahati and Hiyan, besides JNU and Jamia Milia Islamia University’s Northeast wings, participated in the online protest., This is the second online campaign launched by the students from the state. Gauhati University students had in April launched a similar online campaign to save Dehing Patkai rain forest from illegal mining. The move eventually led to the intervention of  Gauhati High Court and several positive steps were taken by Dispur to protect the forest., The Opposition Congress in the state has also moved the environment ministry seeking withdrawal of the draft, with Assam PCC president Ripun Bora objecting to provisions such as exemption to large number of projects from the purview of public hearing, including those falling within 100km of the international border., The Congress also said that the draft allows “toxic industries” to operate from 0 to 5km of protected area, such as a forest and water bodies.\n",

            "umar-khalid - Delhi University professor grilled on riots  - Telegraph India$ 05.08.20$Delhi police on Tuesday questioned a Delhi University professor in connection with the February riots here in which 53 people died, a week after the arrest of another teacher of the varsity over a 2017 Ambedkarite event., Hindi professor Apoorvanand Jha, a public intellectual and pacifist activist of repute in the capital, was grilled by the police’s special cell with respect to an FIR lodged by the police’s anti-terror unit. The FIR accuses several people of planning violent protests against the new citizenship matrix during US President Donald Trump’s visit in February, which the police claim led to the riots., Jha tweeted a statement saying: “Delhi police also considered it necessary to seize my phone for the purpose of investigation. While cooperating and respecting the right of police authorities to conduct a full, fair and thorough investigation, one can only hope that the probe would focus on the real instigators and perpetrators of the violence against a peaceful citizens’ protest and the people of Northeast Delhi.”, The police have told Delhi High Court that “no actionable evidence has surfaced yet”, in response to a query made five months ago on whether the role of BJP leader Kapil Mishra should be investigated in connection with the riots. Mishra had delivered a provocative speech that immediately preceded the riots that began on February 23., Jha appealed for the “harassment and victimisation” of the anti-citizenship regime protesters to stop., “It should not lead to further harassment and victimisation of the protesters and their supporters who asserted their democratic rights through constitutional means, while stating their dissent to the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, and the decision of the GoI to operationalise the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens all over the country. It is disturbing to see a theory emerging which treats the supporters of the protesters as the source of violence,” the professor said in the statement., The FIR, which does not name Prof. Jha, has been called “all-encompassing” in court by a defence lawyer as it has been expanded to include several activists. Among those named are former JNU student Umar Khalid and current JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita of the women students’ group Pinjra Tod, besides another member of the group, Gulfisha Fatima. The Pinjra Tod trio are behind bars., The FIR also includes the names of Jamia Millia Islamia students Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider and Asif Iqbal, and alumni office-bearer Shifa-ur-Rehman. Besides Zargar, who is pregnant and had spent 74 days in jail, the rest continue to be in custody., Also in jail and named in the FIR are suspended Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain, who is accused of abetting the murder of an Intelligence Bureau employee, former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan and rights activist Khalid Saifi. Umar Khalid was questioned on Friday., Last week, DU associate professor of English Hany Babu M.T. had been arrested over a 2017 Elgaar Parishad Ambedkarite event that had been linked to violence the next day in which one person had died, Maoist connections and an alleged plot to target the Prime Minister’s rallies. On Sunday, the NIA searched Hany Babu’s home., Activists have spoken out against the arrests and other police actions that seem to be based on the people concerned’s association with those under investigation., G. Haragopal of the Committee for the Defence and Release of G.N. Saibaba said in a statement: “The raid at his (Hany Babu’s) house… was ostensibly to collect material to corroborate the arrest. It defies all logic that the arrest of Dr Babu was made without sufficient basis, to the point that the NIA now finds itself searching for material to justify the arrest, post-facto and concocting false ‘evidence’ against him.”, “We are also given to understand that the material confiscated from Dr Babu’s house during this second raid was almost solely to do with the Committee for the Defence and Release of G.N. Saibaba…. This smacks of an ulterior motive, viz., to criminalise this committee and its members, through the principle of ‘guilty by association’.”, Hany Babu had been active in the committee fighting for Saibaba, a disabled DU professor serving a life sentence in Nagpur since 2014 for Maoists links.\n",

            "editorial - Let go: The law against sedition - Telegraph India$ 07.10.20$Indian politicians love to hang on to laws from the colonial era — the law against sedition is an example. Inscribed as Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, sedition is the incitement through speech or act to rebel against the authority of the government or the monarch. It made sense when there was a colonial government. The law becomes irrelevant in a democracy where the relationship between the people and their government is supposed to be different; even the United Kingdom repealed it in 2010. In a multi-party democracy that sees freedom of expression as a fundamental right, criticism and dissent are to be expected. Evidently Indian politicians feel too insecure to let go of old, repressive laws. They cannot let the law against sedition go in spite of having formulated such laws as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, for example, against alleged ‘offences against the State’. Data under this head in the latest National Crime Records Bureau report show that although the number of cases under sedition has risen through the last few years, the conviction rate has fallen sharply, especially in comparison with the cases under the UAPA. Among cases heard, two people were convicted of sedition in 2019 and two in 2018, while 29 and 21 people were acquitted respectively each year. Yet 93 cases of sedition were filed in 2019, although 70 in 2018, and 56 in 2017., The story behind the data is a comment on the attitude of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre that is reflected also in the culture of BJP-ruled states. The law against sedition is simply one weapon in an arsenal to silence dissent: the Jharkhand chief minister, for instance, ordered 3,000 charges of sedition against anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protestors to be dropped. Recommendations to repeal the law have been ignored; the present government says it is needed to combat “anti-national, secessionist and terrorist” elements. But it is one thing to file a sedition case, quite another to prove it. It is not a question of bundling out foreign rulers or a king. This is a democracy where freedom of expression is the people’s fundamental right. The NCRB data on poor conviction rate in sedition cases would be comic had not the reason behind the cases been so grim.\n",

Your turn next   - Telegraph India$ 05.10.20$Thursday: Rahul Gandhi, MP, Congress., Friday: Derek O’Brien, MP, Trinamul Congress., Saturday: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, general secretary, Congress., Sunday: Jayant Chaudhary, former MP, RLD., When Uttar Pradesh police ran amok during the citizenship protests last winter and were accused of unspeakable brutality, the relative obscurity of the victims probably afforded many in the country an excuse to look the other way and go about their business as usual., Since then, Yogi Adityanath’s law-enforcement machine has raised the bar, graduating to strong-arming elected representatives and other public figures., The events that have unfolded in Hathras, the Uttar Pradesh district were a Dalit girl was brutalised and murdered, in the past few days have one common factor: the deployment of muscle power on public figures., Some citizens are indeed drawing vicarious pleasure from the sight of politicians getting roughed up — a daily occurrence in the lives of many a common man., Some have portrayed it as an essential rite of passage in public life, suggesting you are not an Opposition leader until you have taken a few lathi blows., But such wisecracks have deflected attention from a frightening prospect: if this is how the political elite is being treated in this country, what does it augur for the faceless citizen?, On Sunday, police in Noida apologised to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for a policeman holding her by her kurta on Saturday and said an inquiry by “a senior lady officer” had been ordered., “We, at Noida police, are committed to ensuring the safety and dignity of women,” the district police said in a statement, presumably unaware of the irony., But that did not prevent the police in Hathras from wielding the lathi on a group led by Jayant Chaudhary, former MP and grandson of former Prime Minister and peasant rights crusader Chaudhary Charan Singh. Jayant was saved only because his supporters formed a protective ring around him and took several blows on themselves., The police, who wielded the baton at least a dozen times on Sunday to break up any form of gathering in the village, rushed towards Jayant as soon as he had stepped out of the victim’s house and begun speaking to the media., Footage showed policemen beating back Jayant and those accompanying him., Jayant, a Rashtriya Lok Dal leader who had represented Mathura from 2009 to 2014, later uploaded a video of the assault and tweeted in Hindi: “If you have the right to wield the baton, I have the right to stand by my people. Wield the baton as much as you want, our resolve will only grow stronger…. Save democracy.”, Jayant, a graduate from the London School of Economics, told journalists while leaving the village: “I was talking to reporters when the police suddenly started wielding batons. My supporters saved me, but many got injured in the process.”, He accused the government of bullying the victim’s family. “I don’t demand anything except justice for the family. Unfortunately, the government wants narco tests on the victim’s family, which means it wants to target them.”, At least two dozen villagers in Hathras suffered injuries as the police attacked them with sticks through the day to prevent people from gathering. Many of them had merely stepped out of their homes out of curiosity at the flurry of activity in the village., Samajwadi Party members who had also gone to meet the victim’s family were assaulted. Samajwadi president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who was not part of the team, said: “The government will not be able to suppress the movement as long as the guilty are not punished.”, Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary, home, did not respond to a message from this newspaper asking the reason behind the frequent police beatings., Not that the police are wielding the lathi indiscriminately. “The police are offering chairs to Rajput goondas. Our lives are in danger,” said the brother of the Hathras victim on Sunday., He said upper caste Rajputs were camping in and around the village to harm the family. “They were helping the police lathicharge those demanding justice for us,” the brother added., A video clip showed a man wearing a tilak on his forehead threatening and shouting at unseen villagers. He accuses them of not having faith in the CBI or the SIT and adds: “Ek baar mulakaat kar, hum tujhe bharosa dilayenge (Meet us once, we will ensure you have faith.)”\n",

And the actions of the authorities in Uttar Pradesh send shivers down our spines. We must act, otherwise women will not be able to even walk around safely anymore,” said Afreen, who lives in Topsia., The women had gathered in front of Park Circus Maidan and walked till the gate of the college., Emotions ran high and the participants shouted “Hum sub ek hai.

We cannot let our opponents create a narrative,” said the source., A section of the party’s state leadership feels that the defeat it had to face in the bypolls in three legislative seats last year — within six months of bagging 18 Lok Sabha seats from the state — was because of the state unit’s failure to counter the anti-CAA narrative of Mamata Banerjee and other parties. The party can’t afford to make the same mistake this time, the source said., “For the first time, our party is so close to coming to power...

Kishan Reddy said: “The high-level committee constituted by the ministry of home affairs on Clause 6 of Assam Accord has submitted its report to the government of Assam and its recommendations are under examination of the state government.”, AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya tweeted on Thursday, “Planned inaction &amp; reluctance of @mygovindia in implementing Clause VI Committee Report of #AssamAccord is clear. Centre’s claim that @mygovassam is yet to forward report shows hypocrisy &amp; insincerity. Demand safeguard as enshrined in Report alongside fulfilment of PM &amp; HM’s promise.”, Bhattacharjya was part of the 14-member committee, led by Justice (retired) Biplab Kumar Sarma, constituted by the ministry of home affairs in July 2019 to suggest measures on how to implement Clause 6 within six months. The committee submitted its report to Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in presence of his cabinet colleagues on February 25 this year after it could not get an audience with home minister Amit Shah, something which did not go down well with the panel members., However, on August 12, All Assam Students Union president Dipanka Nath, general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi and Bhattacharjya made the report public since the government was allegedly sitting on it for five months and there was “public demand” to know about the report and its recommendations., Bhattacharjya told The Telegraph that he wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Shah to honour their “ public commitment” vis-à-vis the Clause 6 report., “The Centre’s response reflects its insincerity. The report has not reached the Centre even after six months. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to implement the recommendations after getting the report. The home minister made a commitment in Parliament to implement the report in toto. We want them to implement the recommendations and warn the government against playing with the report,” Bhattacharjya said., He said that Clause 6 is the right of the Assamese people and it has got nothing to do with the CAA which came into effect in January., According to the 1985 Assam Accord, a culmination of the six-year-long movement against influx, the cut-off date for detection and deportation of illegal foreigners is March 24, 1971., The CAA provides Indian citizenship to non-Muslims who entered from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 2014. The anti-CAA protesters feel that the Act is a threat to the identity and culture of the Assamese people., “We have taken the burden of illegal foreigners till 1971 for which we got Clause 6. We won’t accept any more burden. That should be very clear,” Bhattacharjya said., AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi and his Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) counterpart Palash Changmai told this newspaper that the government has left them with no option but to hit the streets to protest against the insincerity and speedy implementation of the Clause 6 report. “We stand vindicated in our decision to release the report. The report is still with Dispur after six months. We will not stay silent,” Gogoi said., Changmai, like Gogoi, said that the government formed the Clause 6 committee to curb the anti-CAA protests which claimed five lives in the state in December last year. “The BJP government is not at all serious about the issues of Assam and the Northeast. It has compelled us to hit the streets seeking implementation of the Clause 6 report recommendations,” Changmai said., Both the AASU and the AJYCP, which have been at the forefront of the anti-CAA movement, are backing the newly-formed Assam Jatiya Parishad, a regional political party formed to work for the interest of the Assamese people, by unseating the BJP in the 2021 Assembly polls., The alleged inaction has provided the new party the right ammunition to attack the BJP-led government’s insincerity., “We have no option but to take the issue to the people. Without democratic protests, our voices are not heard,” Changmai said., BJP leaders had criticised the release of the report because the committee had given two years’ time to implement its recommendations which included defining an Assamese person who has been living in Assam prior to January 1, 1951, and 80-100 per cent reservation of seats from Assam in Parliament, Assembly and local bodies for Assamese candidates, among others.

            "police-brutality - Plea to President Ram Nath Kovind for Delhi riot probe - Telegraph India$ 18.09.20$Leaders of five political parties on Thursday sought President Ram Nath Kovind’s intervention in getting the government to order an inquiry into Delhi police’s investigation of the February riots, including their “fishing expedition” against protesters against the new citizenship matrix., In a joint letter, leaders of the Congress, CPM, CPI, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the DMK urged the President to call on the Centre to institute a probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, headed by a sitting or retired judge., Like many others before them, the signatories have alleged bias in the Delhi police’s probe, which has ignored provocative speeches by BJP politicians while accusing the riot victims of incitement and violence and booking activists and students who had protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act., “The investigation cannot be allowed to become a fishing and roving expedition aimed at causing a chilling effect on dissent and protest in the country,” the letter, submitted to the President in person, said., “There are, however, serious questions about the role played by the Delhi police itself during the violence and also the manner in which the police is harassing and attempting to falsely implicate activists and young people who took part in the anti-CAA/NRC/NPR movements as the perpetrators of violence,” Thursday’s letter said., It cited accounts and videos that suggested the police were complicit in the violence, directing the stone-throwing mobs or looking the other way when rioters were on the rampage., The letter highlighted the police’s recent effort to “falsely implicate” political leaders including CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury –a signatory to the joint letter – in a supplementary chargesheet.It also flagged the “notable silence in the chargesheets on the role of leaders associated with the BJP who gave inflammatory speeches”, and said this raised concern about the probe’s impartiality., “In fact even when people have courageously filed complaints against BJP leaders – Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma, Satya Pal Singh, Jagdish Pradhan, Nand Kishore Gujjar and Mohan Singh Bisht – accusing them of participating in or orchestrating the violence, there has been no action by the Delhi police,” the letter said., It contrasted this with the way the police had tried to criminalise the protests against the new citizenship regime and portray the countrywide agitation against it as a conspiracy._“The FIR (59/2020) regarding this ‘conspiracy’ being investigated by the (police’s) Special Cell, in which the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been invoked, is being used to carry out a fishing and roving inquiry against activists and young persons who were involved with the protests,” the letter said., Besides Yechury, the signatories were Ahmed Patel (Congress), D. Raja (CPI), Manoj Jha (RJD) and Kanimozhi (DMK).\n",

            "assam - Akhil Gogoi seeks unity against communal forces - Telegraph India$ 09.09.20$Assam peasant rights group Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) chief adviser Akhil Gogoi has urged the people to put up a united fight in the next Assembly polls to protect the Assamese community from “communal” politics., Gogoi, who is in jail since December 12 last year after he was arrested during the peak of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests, said that only “one united, strong and inclusive regional party” with “one flag and one goal” could save Assam. “I want to tell something to the people of Assam. We need to have only one strong inclusive regional party or else the Assamese community will die. The presence of 10-15 regional parties will not help. Seat sharing will also not help us,” Akhil said while he was being taken for a medical check-up on Monday., “We have to unite to save Assam or else this Hindu-Muslim politics will continue for another 30 to 50 years, by which time the Assamese community will be finished. If we unite, it will trigger a political storm in Assam politics that will sweep away the RSS-BJP and the Congress-AIUDF. I therefore appeal to the AASU, the AJYCP, the KMSS and other regional forces to float one strong and inclusive political party,” said the peasant leader, who is known for speaking his mind., Akhil also urged the people to continue with the anti-CAA movement. The Act is seen as a threat to Assam’s culture and identity. He also took a dig at Dispur’s financial assistance of Rs 830 per month to needy women in each family during the ongoing pandemic as insignificant. “Each family should get at least Rs 10,000,” he said., Akhil’s appeal assumes significance because leading student organisations and citizen groups have announced the formation of a regional party to unseat the ruling BJP in the 2021 Assembly polls., The formation of a new regional alternative, backed by two leading youth organisations of the state — All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) — is likely to be announced this week., The KMSS has already announced a political party. Senior advocate Arup Borabora and filmmaker Jahnu Baruah are the leading lights of the recently floated United Regional Party, Assam, while Rajya Sabha MP Ajit Kumar Bhuyan is leading the Anchalik Gana Morcha., The avowed goal of these parties is to strengthen regionalism and oust the ruling BJP from power. But political observers say that unless they unite they will be no match for the well-entrenched BJP or even the Opposition Congress and the AIUDF., According to observers, the RSS and the BJP are trying to polarise the state along religious lines. The BJP accuses the AIUDF of espousing the cause of illegal Bangladeshi Muslims even though it has several Hindu MLAs and leaders. The Congress and the AIUDF have announced their intent of forging a pre-poll alliance., Even the 16-member Assam Paramarshadata Committee (advisory committee) formed by the AASU and the AJYCP to suggest measures and the mechanism for their implementation for “securing” the future of Assam and Assamese people reportedly wants regional forces to unite., KMSS president Bhasco D Saikia said it is in favour of an alliance of regional and anti-BJP forces. According to him, Akhil has mooted the unity of all regional forces to save the state from anti-Assam and communal forces., Reacting to Akhil’s call, AASU president Dipanka Nath told The Telegraph that all such political decisions will be taken by the proposed regional party. “As AASU, we cannot comment on what the proposed party will do. We are also for unity of the regional forces,” Nath said.\n",

An alligator-skin handbag from a boutique in France worth 26,000 has been destroyed because it was imported without a permit. But what about the alligator that was killed and skinned for the sake of fashion only for the bag to be destroyed? Many fashion brands are going ethical; yet as long as designs that use faux fur and leather exist, there will always be a demand for the real stuff. Each and every animal is a key part of the earth’s ecological balance; without them, no amount of emission cuts can save us., Roshni SenCalcutta, Sir — Sankarshan Thakur must be lauded for speaking the hard truth in his article, “Compliant and complicit” (Sep 2). Indeed the series of brutal and heartless incidents taking place in New India — the bringing down of the iron fist in Kashmir, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, ministers telling people “goli maaro sa***n ko” — have not been imposed upon us; rather it is the ordinary Indians who have voted and re-elected this regime with the goal of exercising muscular majoritarianism. This is why this regime dares to indulge in laying the foundation stone of the Ram Temple amidst a pandemic that is killing thousands every day. Yet, instead of being criticized for it, the government is applauded by the people. , People should have asked why the government was busy entertaining Donald Trump and putting up a grand show for him, imposing unnecessary, divisive laws and toppling an elected dispensation in Madhya Pradesh when it should have been ensuring that the coronavirus pandemic did not spread in India. But they chose instead to bang pots and pans at the clarion call of the prime minister at a time when the pandemic was tightening its grip on the nation with millions of poor Indians on the streets following the lockdown., Have we lost all sense of what is right and wrong that we are dancing to the rhetorical tune of certain individuals without questioning either their authority or their motives? Just because the government of the day is pandering to the Hindutva constituency — this seems to comprise large pockets of India — all scandals and failures of the regime are being condoned in spite of its horrendous record in tackling any problem, whether it is the sovereignty of India or its economy. , People do get the government they deserve and we are compliant and complicit with those who are causing untold damages to India and Indians., Kajal ChatterjeeCalcutta, Sir — The article, “Compliant and complicit”, zeroes in on some of the most dismal aspects of present-day India. Sankarshan Thakur elaborates on numerous instances which show that we are living with lies wantonly piled upon us by a regime that will not stop at anything to consolidate power. At the bidding of the prime minister we clap, turn off lights and believe in unbelievable, absurd fantasies. We watch him feed a bird before going on to narrate a rather well-crafted ‘mann ki baat’ where he speaks of the virtues of native dog breeds, toy-making and food and nutrition at a time when the country has failed in all aspects — political, social, economic, administrative, judicial and diplomatic., Jahar SahaCalcutta, Sir — In his article Sankarshan Thakur has rightly analysed how the current political dispensation is keeping us in the dark about its failures by spreading lies. He has rightly remarked that “we are a living parade of the compliant and the complicit”. People are blindly following what they are asked to do without thinking of the consequences. It looks as though they have been hypnotized and have lost all sense of scepticism. Instead of asking questions we are applauding every useless act and unnecessary decision of the current establishment. Both social and mainstream media have played a vital role in sweeping the failures of the government under the carpet by diverting people’s attention from real issues. This attitude is not good for democracy. The media must play its role sincerely and honestly., Yousuf IqbalCalcutta\n",

My family felt that we would be safe here. I wanted to spend some quality time with my family,” Khan told a news conference in Jaipur., The doctor, who spent eight months in jail following his arrest over an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act speech at Aligarh Muslim University, said he had been falsely implicated and sent to jail by the Uttar Pradesh government as he had exposed the system., On Tuesday, Allahabad High Court had quashed Khan’s detention under the NSA and ordered his immediate release, saying the Uttar Pradesh government had done a “selective reading” of his anti-CAA speech. The medical doctor had called for national integrity and not incited violence, the court observed., Khan said on Thursday: “I was leading a simple life. I tried to expose the system as children died at BRD Medical College (in Gorakhpur) because of lack of oxygen. This did not go down well with our chief minister. A false case was lodged and I was sent to jail.”, He added that he was tortured and asked “weird questions” after being arrested in January for the December speech at AMU. The Uttar Pradesh government had invoked the stringent NSA against him after he was granted bail in February and kept extending his detention by three months at a time., “I was not given water for 72 hours after being taken into custody,” Khan said., “I was physically tortured after the STF arrested me. I was asked weird questions like if I have invented a powder to kill people and visited Japan to topple the government.”, The doctor had made the same allegations in a video message on Wednesday., “The interrogators told me that I had made a powder that would instantly kill people. I said, ‘Brother, I’m a children’s doctor, how can I make a powder? Are you talking about corona? If so, ask China.’ They told me they had audio proof that I had planned to pull down the government. I asked them to show me the evidence, which they didn’t have,” he said., “They asked me why I had gone to Japan. I said instead of Japan, you should have said Pakistan. Tell me, how can I go to Japan if my passport is (with the) court?”Khan’s passport was impounded on a court’s direction after the 2017 Gorakhpur child death tragedy., Khan said: “Often, they wouldn’t give me anything to eat for five days at a stretch.... They tortured me mentally and physically.”, He alleged that he used to be hung upside down and beaten in jail. “I used to treat children suffering from malnutrition, now I’m suffering from malnutrition myself because of the poor quality of jail food.”, Khan had said in the video message: “People are saying the government may try to implicate me in one case or another. They can also get me killed in an encounter. Maybe this is my last conversation with you.”, On Thursday, Khan said he had feared for his life after his arrest., “State-sponsored victimisation of my family and myself has been going on. I feared (being) killed in an encounter. I’m thankful to the STF that they did not kill me while bringing me to Uttar Pradesh,” he said., Khan said he would urge Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to give him back his job in the state medical services., “As the high court has quashed the charges under the NSA against me, I would write to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister to reinstate me in the medical service,” Khan told the media conference in Jaipur., “If I’m not allowed, I will hold medical camps in flood-affected areas of Assam as an activist.”, He said his arrest had affected his family. “My 65-year-old mother, my wife had to frequently visit the Supreme Court during the pandemic. My brothers’ businesses were destroyed. My seven-and-a-half-month-old son doesn’t recognise me and runs off to my brother’s lap. I don’t think any government can cause me bigger pain than this,” Khan said.\n",

            "romila-thapar - Resistance hope rests on youth, not parties: Patnaik - Telegraph India$ 03.09.20$Prabhat Patnaik, economist and professor emeritus at JNU in conversation with Subhoranjan Dasgupta, professor of human science:, Dasgupta: In one of her recent lectures, eminent historian Romila Thapar said the Indian republic was teetering on the borderline. On one side of the border stood the secular Indian republic and on the other side a Hindu rashtra. Do you endorse this point of view?, Patnaik: Yes, I agree that the republic is teetering on the cusp of a momentous transition, but I see the two sides of this cusp somewhat differently. On one side is a secular, democratic, federal republic where citizens are free of fear and enjoy a set of political rights defended by an independent judiciary; on the other is an authoritarian State where fear is pervasive and all institutions are subservient to the executive, which uses Hindutva as its vote-catching device but works essentially to further the interests of big capital, both domestic and foreign., “Hindu rashtra” is not a Hindu State in the sense of promoting the interests of the Hindus. It is an authoritarian State that suppresses not just Muslims but workers, peasants, petty producers, tribal people, oppressed castes, artists and intellectuals the bulk of whom are Hindus, and promotes the interests of a corporate-financial oligarchy. Its electoral plank is Hindutva, but Hindutva never filled anyone’s belly; it calls its goal a “Hindu rashtra”, but that is a misnomer., Perhaps the most powerful example of the oncoming Hindu rashtra is the picture showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi lying prostrate before the image of Ram in Ayodhya. Was this public display of devotion at all necessary?, A Prime Minister like anyone else can have his personal religious beliefs, but to project the picture of his lying prostrate before the image of Ram is to appeal to people in the name of religion. This political use of religion is necessary for Modi precisely because his government cannot deliver on bread-and-butter issues that affect people’s lives., The country, even before the pandemic, was facing the most acute economic crisis since Independence. Between 2011-12 and 2017-18, the per capita real consumer expenditure in rural India declined by 9 per cent, which is so massive and unprecedented that the government suppressed the NSS data showing this. The pandemic has added greatly to this crisis., The government’s own panacea for the crisis is to make fiscal transfers to the corporates, suppress workers’ rights, privatise public-sector assets, make land acquisition easy, and so on, which the corporates relish without making an iota of investment. Investment depends on the growth of demand; but demand will actually shrink because of these measures, since a rupee transferred from the poor to the rich reduces the overall consumption demand. The public display of religious devotion becomes necessary in this context., With due deference to the Supreme Court, could it be said that the Babri Masjid verdict was also somewhat partial? You condemn the demolition of the Babri Masjid as a criminal act but in the same breath you grant the demolishers the right of building a grand temple in the disputed place. Is this an example of righteous justice?, The verdict rewards vandalism. If the masjid had not been demolished, the Supreme Court would not even have entertained a petition regarding the ownership of that land, just as it would not if some people claimed that the Raja Rani temple in Bhubaneswar stood on land belonging to their ancestors. It is the masjid’s destruction that gave post facto pertinence to this issue of ownership of that land. The Supreme Court verdict therefore actually rewarded vandalism which it simultaneously condemned as a criminal act., In order to smoothen the passage to Hindu rajya, the present rulers are subverting each and every public institution, including the Election Commission. Some claim that even the judiciary’s sacrosanct independent functioning is being affected. Doesn’t this calculated sabotage remind you of similar programmes implemented by other authoritarian regimes?, Yes, such subversion is the modus operandi of all such outfits, of which the RSS (with its front organisations) is a classic example. The Modi government uses a combination of carrot-and-stick methods, and places its followers in key positions, to subjugate public institutions like the Election Commission, Enforcement Directorate, CBI, Delhi police and the NIA. The media, with notable exceptions, are subjugated and the judiciary too is widely perceived to have become significantly subservient to the executive., Of course, the Modi government has been aided by several draconian laws existing from earlier times, including sedition laws from colonial times. The overall effect is to create an atmosphere of fear, criminalise dissent, produce conformism, punish critics and make all institutions serve its political agenda., Will the Hindus — or, better put, the Sangh parivar — demand the demolition of similar “mixed” shrines in Kashi and Mathura?, Since religion is being used for political purposes, the demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura will be effected if it becomes politically necessary — for instance, if the electorate becomes restive because of the accentuating economic crisis. It is not the “Hindus” who “demand” any demolition; it’s the Sangh parivar that raises these demands to instigate a section of the majority community. It does so for political mileage, so that its blatant but counterproductive pro-corporate policies escape the electorate’s fury., How could there be a return to the reality of the secular republic from the borderline? By unleashing people’s movements and by positing a united opposition of the political parties?, The political parties, by and large, have not escaped the carrot-and-stick methods of the Modi government. I do not expect them to take the lead in organising resistance. I put my faith in the innumerable young men and women who deeply abhor what is going on and who can initiate resistance, as it became clear during the anti-CAA movement. I also expect an upsurge of movements of workers and peasants because of their extreme hardship., Such upsurges will then overcome the paralysis of the political parties, forcing them to come together on a common minimum programme that must be not just political but also economic. The Left will have a big role to play in fashioning such a programme and forging political resistance against the spectre of fascism.\n",

It also nowhere threatens peace and tranquillity of the city of Aligarh. The address gives a call for national integrity and unity among the citizens. The speech also deprecates any kind of violence. It appears that the district magistrate had selective reading and selective mention for few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent.”, The court was hearing a writ petition filed by Khan’s mother Nuzhat Parveen challenging the doctor’s detention against the NSA. Parveen had initially moved the Supreme Court, which transferred the case to Allahabad High Court., Khan had addressed students at AMU on December 12 last year during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The court noted that he had been arrested on the charges of “provoking religious sentiments” and attempting to “incite hatred, enmity and disharmony” to cause an “adverse impact on the harmony between the communities” and disturb public peace., The high court said Khan’s detention under the NSA after being granted bail by a competent court in February was illegal. A person can be held without trial for 12 months under the NSA. Khan is lodged in Mathura jail., Allahabad High Court said that a “causal link is found to be missing or completely broken” in the case., “In the absence of any material indicating that the detainee continued to act in a manner prejudicial to public order from December 12, 2019, up to February 13, 2020 (when Khan was booked under the NSA), or that he committed any such… further act as may have had that effect, the preventive detention order cannot be sustained,” the court said., The court added: “In fact, the grounds of detention are silent as to public order at Aligarh being at risk of any prejudice in February 2020 on account of the offending act attributed to the detainee on the date December 12, 2019., “What remains is a mere apprehension expressed by the detaining authority without supporting material on which such apprehension may be founded.”, The court noted that Khan had during the AMU speech said that “Mota Bhai” — elder brother in Gujarati and a term sometimes used to refer to Amit Shah and Narendra Modi — wanted to see people either as Hindu or Muslim, that crores would be spent to send people to detention centres and that the healthcare system had broken down. The court noted that Khan had said “they talk about shamshaan-kabristan, Ali-Bajrang Bali, your Kashmir, Ram Mandir, CAB, NRC. They don’t talk about the promise that they made for 2 crore jobs per year. They don’t talk about giving Rs 15 lakh to us as earlier said by them. The economy is doomed, small businessmen are ruined.”, Explaining why Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath had targeted him, Khan had said: “The talk about nationalism is actually pseudo-nationalism, on the basis of pseudo-Hinduism only.”, The court said Khan was given a compact disk containing his speech at AMU for him to prepare his representation but no player was made available., “The grounds for detention along with material were supplied to the detainee in light of Clause (5) of Article 22 of the Constitution, enabling him to submit his representation to the competent authorities at the earliest. The material so given was a compact disk of the speech delivered by Dr Kafeel Khan on 12th December, 2019, at Bab-e-Syed gate of Aligarh Muslim University. On asking, it is conveyed to us that no transcript of the speech was supplied to the detainee. The non-supply of transcript would have been of no consequence if a device would have been supplied to the detainee to play the compact disk. It is the position admitted that no such device was made available to the detainee,” the court noted., The court observed that the orders extending Khan’s detention were never given to him. “The record shown to us and the pleadings of the petition also refer that only radiograms relating to the decision of the state government for extension of the term of detention were supplied to the detainee,” it said. “The radiograms mention that the actual order shall be sent through speed post but in fact nothing except the radiograms were given to the detainee.”, The court added: “In light of the discussion above, we are having no hesitation in concluding that neither the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act, 1980, nor the extension of the detention are sustainable in the eye of law,” it said., The Uttar Pradesh government had in August extended Khan’s detention under the NSA by three months, saying that an advisory council had noted in its report that there were “enough reasons” to keep him in jail., “The order of detention dated 13th February, 2020, passed by the district magistrate, Aligarh, and confirmed by the state of Uttar Pradesh is set aside. The extension of the period of detention of… Dr Kafeel Khan is also declared illegal. A writ in the nature of habeas corpus is hereby issued to release Dr Kafeel Khan… from State custody forthwith,” the court said on Tuesday., Khan had earlier been arrested in 2017 following the deaths of children at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das Medical College because of lack of oxygen cylinders. Khan had been the nodal officer of the 100-bed encephalitis ward of the medical college. It later emerged that the company that had been assigned to ensure uninterrupted supply of liquid oxygen had disrupted delivery because of non-payment of dues by the state government. Khan and nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital had been arrested and later granted bail., An Uttar Pradesh government committee had later absolved Khan of any wrongdoing. The doctor had then alleged that chief minister Adityanath did not like him because he had spoken the truth about the case.\n",

Assam is the only state to have the 1951 NRC. The cut-off mark for inclusion was March 24, 1971, as fixed in the 1985 Assam Accord, an outcome of the six-year-long Assam Movement against influx., Issues related to the 1985 Accord and the NRC update dominated the House proceedings on Monday., Ahmed had asked, among others, whether rejection slips are being issued by NRC authorities and if there is any timeframe for completing the entire process., Patowary, replying on behalf chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, said no rejection slip has been issued till now., The process has been kept on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the flood situation in the state, he said., The senior minister then said the state government had moved the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the update, in July 2019 seeking a direction for 20 per cent sample re-verification of names included in the draft NRC in districts bordering Bangladesh and a 10 per cent sample re-verification of names in the remaining districts. , Patowary then revealed that the “state government continues to remain strongly in favour of such re-verification”. , The Supreme Court had, however, rejected the re-verification pleas of both the state and the central governments., The districts bordering Bangladesh are Karimkanj and Cachar in Barak Valley and Dhubri and South Salmara-Mankachar in lower Assam., The length of the Indo-Bangladesh border in Assam is 267km., Assam has 33 districts., Applicants who did not make the updated NRC list can challenge their exclusion in the foreigners tribunals after getting the rejection slips which would mention the reason for their non-inclusion. The excluded were directed to move the tribunals within 120 days of the publication of the final list but till date, according to the government, no rejection slips have been issued., Patowary also said there was “no specific timeframe for completion” of the whole process yet. He also said 100 foreigners tribunals are functioning in the state., Patowary also said no genuine citizens would be left out of the NRC and no illegal migrants included in the list., He also said despite opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, not a single Bangladeshi citizen had entered any of the state’s 26,000 villages., Like the state government, Assam Public Works, an NGO, whose petition in the apex court led to the update of the 1951 NRC, too reiterated on Monday its demand for re-verification of the updated list., Congress MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi targeted the government over the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord and coronavirus., He had to be suspended for sometime after he did not heed the Speaker’s request not to disrupt proceedings. Outside the Assembly, Kurmi said he was expelled because he was “raising” the voice of the people of Assam., All Assam Students’ Union general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi told The Telegraph they were and are still firm on an “error-free NRC” where “no Indian is left out and no foreigner included”., Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti president Bhasco De Saikia said Dispur should display its sincerity by involving all stakeholders and publish the NRC in a time-bound manner instead of using the “NRC as a political tool” because the exercise was initiated to rid Assam of illegal foreigners., The Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), a youth organisation at the forefront of the anti-CAA movement along with the AASU, said the state government should now initiate steps to complete the NRC process in a time-bound manner.\n",

However, he was not released for four days and the National Security Act (NSA) was subsequently invoked against him. Hence, his detention was illegal., Khan has been in jail since January after he delivered the allegedly provocative speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in December last year. He is lodged in Mathura jail., Parveen, who left for Mathura soon after the court pronounced its order, said she is very happy that her son is coming out of jail and she will be able to see him after long., Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hailed the court's decision and hoped the Uttar Pradesh government will immediately release Khan \"without any malice\"., Quashing Khan's detention order, the court said, \"A complete reading of the speech primafacie does not disclose any effort to promote hatred or violence.

The speech also deprecates any kind of violence., \"It appears that the District Magistrate had selective reading and selective mention for few phrases from the speech ignoring its true intent.\", The court further said in the instant case, the \"causal link is found to be missing or completely broken\"., \"In absence of any material indicating that the detainee continued to act in a manner prejudicial to public order from December 12, 2019 up to February 13, 2020, or that he committed any such other or further act as may have had that effect, the preventive detention order cannot be sustained,\" it said., \"In fact, the grounds of detention are silent as to public order at Aligarh being at risk of any prejudice in February 2020 on account of the offending act attributed to the detainee on the date December 12, 2019,\" the court said in its order., \"What remains is a mere apprehension expressed by the detaining authority without supporting material on which such apprehension may be founded,\" it said., The court said it had also tested the legality of the detention \"on the count of giving effective opportunity to the detainee to represent at earliest\"., \"The grounds for detention along with material were supplied to the detainee in light of clause (5) of Article 22 of the Constitution of India enabling him to submit representation to the competent authorities at earliest,\" it said., \"The material so given was a compact disk of the speech delivered by Dr. Kafeel Khan on 12th December, 2019, at Bab-e-Syed gate of Aligarh Muslim University,\" it said., \"On asking, it is conveyed to us that no transcript of the speech was supplied to the detainee. The non-supply of transcript would have been of no consequence, if a device would have been supplied to the detainee to play the compact disk. It is the position admitted that no such device was made available to the detainee,\" it added., One more important aspect of the matter is that the orders of extension of detention were never served upon the detainee, the court said., \"The record shown to us and the pleadings of the petition also refer that only radiograms relating to decision of the State Government for extension of the term of detention were supplied to the detainee,\" it said., \"The radiograms mention that the actual order shall be sent through speed post but in fact nothing except the radiograms were given to the detainee. In light of the discussion above, we are having no hesitation in concluding that neither detention of Dr. Kafeel Khan under National Security Act, 1980 nor extension of the detention are sustainable in the eye of law,\" it said., Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that he or she is a threat to national security or law and order., Khan has already spent over six months in jail under the NSA., In its order, the court said, \"The writ petition for the reasons above is allowed. The order of detention dated 13th February, 2020 passed by District Magistrate, Aligarh and confirmed by the State of Uttar Pradesh is set aside. The extension of the period of detention of detenue Dr. Kafeel Khan is also declared illegal.\", \"A writ in the nature of habeas corpus is hereby issued to release Dr. Kafeel Khan, the detenue, from State custody forthwith,\" it said., The Uttar Pradesh government had extended Khan's detention under the NSA by three months twice -- in May and August., In an order dated August 4, the Home Department had said the NSA was invoked against Khan on February 13, 2020, on the orders of the Aligarh district magistrate., After this, the matter was sent to the advisory council, which, in its report, said there were \"enough reasons\" to keep Khan in jail., On her way to Mathura, Khan's mother Parveen told PTI on phone, \"I am very happy that my son is coming out of jail. I will be able to see him after a long time.\", \"My son is a good person and he was never against the country or the society. It is also my daughter-in-law's birthday today, and we are taking a cake with us as she is in Mathura,\" she said., Khan, who worked as a paediatrician at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, first hit headlines in 2017 after several children died at the hospital due to the lack of oxygen cylinders., Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for the children for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders. However, later, he faced action along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail., A state government probe cleared Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Yogi Adityanath government., Khan had alleged that an institutional failure had led to the deaths of the children., Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi welcomed the court order., \"The Allahabad High Court today ordered the removal of NSA and immediate release of Dr. Kafeel Khan. It is expected that the UP government will release Dr. Kafeel Khan without any malice,\" she said in a tweet in Hindi., She also congratulated all \"justice-loving people\" and party workers in the state who had been making efforts for Khan's release.\n",

I finished film school and entered a contest called the Chrysler Million Dollar Film festival in 2002 based on my short film The Tower of Babel that I co-wrote, directed and acted in — which was a mistake (laughs). With the film, I had to do a couple of other things in the contest. Ultimately I won it with my writing and producer partner Beau Bauman and we got a million dollars to make my first feature film.That’s a lot of prize money!, It sounds like a lot but it’s not. Trust me. The Avengers must have spent five times that just on snacks. We were acting out of desperation to launch our careers, as 20-somethings with dreams of wanting to make films in Hollywood. This was our opportunity and we were not going to let it pass us by., How did a debutant director get Jon Bon Jovi to act in the film?, So we had this part and was looking for someone to cast in it. I was looking for someone with a rockstar quality, who kids looked up to, that guys liked and the girls had a crush on.   CAA (the agency) pitched us an actual rockstar — Jon Bon Jovi! I said he’s not going to do it. They said: “He might. The script is great and he is available.” To Jon’s credit, he read the script and showed up in Virginia, ready to have some fun with us. I would never have considered him in a million years!How was it directing him?, Fantastic. He is such a creative guy, a real artiste, selfless, easy going. He joked that his security was getting paid more than he was for doing our little independent film. He has such a sense of humour! Am a massive fan. We actually have the same birthday — March 2. And even though it’s been 17 years, we still wish each other by email on the day.You did act in a big-ticket film like Pearl Harbor yourself…, Let me be clear. Every young man in his 20s who was willing to be an actor in Hollywood  was in Pearl Harbor. That’s how big the movie is and that’s how many speaking parts it had. It’s actually more unique to find someone my age who wasn’t in Pearl Harbour than was. I had one line in a scene with Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale. It is about 30 minutes into the movie. I say: “Hurry up, Romeo. I want to get this over with.” You can’t miss it. That movie was so massive that even if I had one line, I worked for three days on it. In my movies, if I have an actor with one line I’d ask them to cut the part and save the money. If it was necessary, I’d get them only for one day., Tell us about The Adrenaline Film Project that you are involved with. How can a film, however short, be made in 72 hours?, It’s a great thing that I helped start in my hometown in east Virginia. We started 15-16 years ago. I am on the board of the Virginia Film Festival and they have a theme each year. The theme that year was speed. I suggested a film production workshop. We did it for a year and it has gone on. We invite people from all over the East Coast. They get to make a movie in 72 hours with me and two other industry professionals producing it and collaborating with them. At the end of the process, we screen their movies, give out awards and have a party. It is a fulfilling process.Coming to Fantasy Island, your film that will be screened on August 30 in India, what is it about?, Fantasy Island is about a place where a group of people could go and have their wildest dreams come true. But there’s always a twist and a price. In many ways, the island is like a mirror. It reflects what is inside of the person. Ultimately the people who survive the island emerge forever changed.Many of your films, be it Fantasy Island or Truth or Dare or Prey or even Cry Wolf, have this recurrent trope of a group of people gathering in a place and things happening to them., I hadn’t thought about it but yeah, many of my films have that. It’s a great way to tell a feature. A feature needs to be a contained story. While there are features that take place over different time periods, they require larger budgets than I have had access to. So if you have a small budget, putting a group of interesting people in a location and having things happen to them is a great recipe for exploring character and narrative., The plot of Fantasy Island brought to mind Agatha Christie’s And Then There Were None., I read the book and have seen the original film. There have been quite a few adaptations. It was a major influence for Fantasy Island.Any actor who you learnt a lot from?I try to learn something from all my major collaborators but I learn the most from my actors. I remember having these long conversations with Andy Garcia, who played the villain in my Netflix movie True Memoirs of an International Assassin. He had great stories and I learnt a lot from him. Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Kevin James, Jon Bon Jovi… I’m grateful to all my actors who participated in my films., Catch the Flix First Premiere of Fantasy Island on Sunday, August 30 at 1pm, 7pm and 9pm on &amp;flix, 3pm and 11pm on &amp;PrivéHD and 2pm on Zee Café\n",

The court has ordered the AGP to maintain status quo till the case comes up for hearing on November 11., Besides the legal tangle, the AGP brass will also have to deal with intra-party differences over the manner in which the new panel was elected., The meeting has vested in Bora the responsibility to form the new team. Working president Keshav Mahanta would continue in his post as he was re-nominated by Bora., Soon after Bora’s election, a group of senior members and leaders from across the state met former AGP president Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and other senior leaders “seeking the ouster” of the party top brass and strengthening it from within., Sources said a section in the party wanted the formation of a new regional outfit because the AGP brass has sided with the ruling party (BJP) in supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act, which is widely opposed in the Brahmaputra Valley. Those opposed to the CAA say it is a threat to Assam’s culture and identity., Bora, who is also a cabinet minister in the BJP-led coalition government, told The Telegraph, “This will be my second straight full term after 2016. I was re-elected unanimously. I plan to take the party forward by turning it into a progressive regional force in run up to the Assembly polls and try to win more seats this time round.”, In the 2016 Assembly elections, the AGP, born out of the six-year-long Assam Agitation against influx, had won 14 of the 24 seats it had contested., On the court order, Bora said they had not received anything during the meeting. “But I heard the office has received something from the court after the meeting but I have not seen it,” he said., Asked about the AGP’s stand on the CAA, he said it was the “same as before”. The party brass had said in December last year it will continue the legal fight against the CAA in the Supreme Court and will also try to get Clause 6 of the Assam Accord implemented, which ensures constitutional safeguards to the Assamese people, by “staying within the government”., Girin Talukdar, a senior AGP member and one of the three petitioners in the case against the party general council meeting, said on Thursday that they will continue their legal fight. “Usually, a general council meeting continues for a whole day but today it got over in about 45 minutes. We will apprise the court about today’s developments despite its restraining order. We will wait and watch and continue with our legal fight,” Talukdar said., Former chief minister and AGP founder president Mahanta said the court had passed a restraining order which he had received while entering the party’s Ambari headquarters. It is a sub judice issue now, he said., Mahanta said he will not speak against any individual but made his displeasure known against the party leadership. He said the people wanted a strong regional party, not one which has submitted to a national party. Bora had become president after Mahanta had stepped down following the AGP’s debacle in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls., Mahanta also said he was firm against CAA and will not accept anything that dilutes the 1985 Assam Accord which has fixed March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for detection and deportation of illegal foreigners., The CAA, on the other hand, provides Indian citizenship to non-Muslims who have entered India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan till December 2014., The AGP general council meeting was scheduled for December last year but had to be deferred because of the anti-CAA agitation and the Covid-induced lockdown.\n",

            "narendra-modi - India: Law changes needed for marital rape, sedition, honour killing - Telegraph India$ 09.07.20$Change happens invisibly, in unexpected directions. It was only in 2017 that the Centre said that criminalizing marital rape would destabilize the institution of marriage and hurt the husband. But now a five-member committee appointed by the Union home ministry is looking at the possibility of a number of reforms of law, including criminalizing marital rape. Change in that direction had already begun, when in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that sex with a minor wife would be marital rape. In the same sphere, the demand for gender-neutral laws against rape and sexual violence has grown acute with the deaths of two men in police custody in Tamil Nadu recently, for the issue there was alleged sexual violence. Laws evolve and are modified or sharpened with changes in society, so issues such as euthanasia, or the need for special laws against mob lynching and honour killing, two crimes that have grown in popularity, are among the subjects being considered. The most politically potent of the committee’s concerns, however, is the decision to ‘revisit’ the law against sedition. Should it require omission, or amendment regarding definition, scope or cognizability, is the committee’s question regarding the sedition law for the online public and expert consultation scheduled to discuss a total of 49 questions., The government that constituted the committee has been accused of repeatedly misusing the law against sedition to silence dissent, criticism, political disagreement or simply contrary opinion. Sedition can be relevant only when there is the possibility of people trying to overthrow a foreign ruler, but Narendra Modi’s government had not been interested in such niceties. The committee’s decision to question the law against sedition, therefore, suggests a remarkable step forward by the government. It should be acknowledged and welcomed, if it means that the Bharatiya Janata Party will support the freedom of opinion and its peaceful expression without allowing violent repression of such freedom by mobs which go scot-free and the use of law as a weapon against dissidents. Since the arrests of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters have continued throughout the lockdown, the change on the ground is obviously yet to come. As long as the law against sedition is revoked or changed meaningfully without something even more arbitrary and repressive taking its place, there is no cause for worry.\n",

            "national-human-rights-commission-nhrc - Contrasting the Black Lives Matter movement in America and the ant-CAA movement in India - Telegraph India$ 08.07.20$On May 25, in Minneapolis, an African-American arrestee, George Floyd, was choked to death by a white police officer pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck. The whole of America erupted in protests, which targeted not just contemporary racism but also historical icons like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, who had either been slave-owners or openly racist. The statues of Confederate leaders during the civil war, Jefferson Davis and Robert Lee, were brought down. The protests even spread to Britain where the statues of some slave traders were brought down and those of Cecil Rhodes and Winston Churchill had to be protected against a similar fate.The protesters spearheading this veritable upsurge for social equality were neither charged with sedition, nor held captive under any UAPA-equivalent law. In fact, Donald Trump’s suggestion for using troops against protesters was opposed by the current Pentagon chief, Mark Esper, and his predecessor, James Mattis; the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, who had accompanied Trump for a photo-op at St John’s Church, just across the White House, after the intervening space had been cleared of protesters, apologized for doing so, pleading lack of prior knowledge that he was being politically used. When right-wing groups wanted to organize counter-protests, they were in general kept completely separate from the protesters to prevent any clashes.Contrast this with the situation in our own country where a similar movement for social equality, the anti-CAA anti-NRC protest against patently discriminatory laws targeting Muslims, which took every conceivable precaution to eschew violence, is being targeted with a vengeance, with several of its participants being booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and that too after the movement was withdrawn because of the pandemic. Amazingly, virtually every institution of the State, including even those charged with defending citizens’ rights, is conniving with this repression. In fact, it is a sad comment on the pusillanimous complicity of virtually every institution of the Indian State in the executive’s repressiveness that 13 human rights experts attached to various UN bodies felt the need to write a joint letter to the Government of India to release those arrested for the anti-CAA agitation; they accused it of sending a “chilling message” to India’s “vibrant civil society” that criticism of government action will not be tolerated.But let us leave aside the current repression against anti-CAA protesters. When the protests had begun, the Delhi police had entered the Jamia Millia Islamia campus on December 15, and used tear gas and lathis against students, including even those who were studying in the library. The police are not supposed to enter any university campus without taking the permission of the vice-chancellor; no such niceties were observed on this occasion. The university authorities even lodged an FIR against the Delhi police. The police claimed that some miscreants, who had damaged public property nearby, had entered the campus to avoid capture, and their own actions were only meant to nab them.Let us momentarily accept this. There can still be no doubt that the brutal and indiscriminate police action inside Jamia led to several innocent students being badly injured. Let alone launching prosecutions against the erring police officers for their high-handedness, the Central government under whom the Delhi police falls, has not even offered any compensation to the injured students. In India where, rightly, the government compensates even those affected by natural calamities, the refusal to compensate victims of wanton and wilful excesses perpetrated by its own forces is an act of blatant discrimination. The National Human Rights Commission, which has just produced a report on Jamia violence, does recommend compensation for injured students; but it wants the Delhi government to make the payment, which is a non-starter. Oddly, it blames students for the police violence and wants the “real actors and motives” behind the protests “uncovered” (The Wire, June 26), as if students are mere manipulable marionettes. How do we explain such contrasting responses of the United States of America and India to similar movements for social equality? Some would argue that ‘communalism’ and racism are quite dissimilar, the latter being a legacy of centuries of inhuman imperialist oppression by metropolitan powers of people of the ‘outlying regions’. But while it is true that the histories of the two phenomena are different, the fact remains that the majority of Muslims in India today are among the poorest people in the world. Their victimization is no less odious than that of the blacks in the US; a movement against an obvious instance of such victimization, the Citizen (Amendment) Act, is as deserving of support as the anti-racist movement sweeping America. How then do we explain the difference in attitudes of the two societies?To say that the US administration is more ‘liberal’ than the Indian one would not do. Cornel West, the philosopher of African-American origin at Columbia, has called Trump a “neo-fascist gangster” in an interview; the fact that he has not been hounded for this remark is not because he is wrong and Trump is indeed more ‘liberal’, but because the US system imposes stricter limits on what Trump can do compared to what the Indian system does on a comparable Indian administration. This only changes our question: why this difference?One may be tempted to say that while the ‘educated’ in India would fight as hard for social equality as in the US, the ‘people’ here are less ‘enlightened’. This alas is untrue, for the capitulation of all the institutions of the State, which are manned by the ‘educated’, before a communal agenda would be otherwise inexplicable. The problem lies with the ‘educated’ themselves.John Maynard Keynes, the economist and ‘liberal’ thinker, had set great store by what he called the “educated bourgeoisie” for the defence of liberal values and for a reformed capitalism that he thought was essential for upholding them. At the other end of the political spectrum, Marx and Engels, in The Communist Manifesto, had talked of socialist consciousness — as distinct from trade union consciousness — being brought to the working class by bourgeois intellectuals who had de-classed themselves and seen the “historical process as a whole”. The role of the ‘educated bourgeoisie’, in short, is crucial in any contemporary society; the difference between the US and India with regard to their respective movements for social equality lies, above all, in the fact that the ‘educated bourgeoisie’ in the US has been more punctilious in playing a democratic role than its counterpart in India which, in turn, has to do with the difference in the two education systems.There is much breast-beating in India about our educational institutions not figuring among the top 200 or so according to some orderings. This is a totally false criterion of excellence; far more crucial is whether our education system imparts to students, not by rote or ritual, the fundamental value of social equality that underlies our Constitution.Meanwhile, before we accept as the new ‘normal’ a situation where the police enters campuses and beats up innocent students with impunity, where socially-conscious students fighting for equality are put into jails under the UAPA, we must remember that we pride ourselves on being the largest democracy in the world.\n",

            "narendra-modi - Letters to the editor July 5, 2020: Lost ground-Narendra Modi's Ladakh visit - Telegraph India$ 06.07.20$Sir — The prime minister, Narendra Modi, sprang a surprise with his sudden Ladakh visit. It was primarily meant to be a gesture of solidarity with the armed forces in order to boost the morale of soldiers guarding the borders at high altitudes. But before lapping up the meticulously choreographed visit, Modi’s ardent supporters should consider the serious rupture in relations with a neighbouring country. It is not advisable to underestimate China by thinking that it was ‘spooked’ and ‘rattled’ by Delhi’s hard-line position vis-à-vis Beijing’s territorial claims., But it must be admitted that Modi’s address to soldiers in Ladakh was replete with multiple messages, in sharp contrast to his cagey speech at the end of his online meeting with Opposition leaders in which he did not admit to any intrusion into India having taken place. The general tenor of his rousing Ladakh address indicated that he was salvaging the situation and asserting India’s position on border disputes. The thrust of the address was that countries should renounce territorial expansionism and seek peace and prosperity. Although the prime minister did not name China, his allusion to ‘expansionism’ left no one in any doubt about the country he had in mind., It is true that the gestures of amity made by Modi towards the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to build better relations between India and China did not yield the desired results. Yet, it is important to make efforts to bring about a rapprochement between the two countries. War is not an option because of the terrible cost it exacts in terms of death and suffering., G. David Milton, Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu, Sir — Narendra Modi’s visit to Ladakh ended up being a philosophical introspection on life rather than a strong political message to China. Why is he always hesitant to mention China’s name? China has no such qualms while warning India off., While Modi is trying to take credit for India’s diplomatic move against China in the form of banning 59 Chinese apps, it is doubtful that this will have any far-reaching impact on the Chinese economy. Moreover, can the void left behind by the Chinese apps be filled by indigenous companies immediately? It is clear that the ban has been imposed because this is easier than banning products that people rely on in their daily lives. Does the cash-strapped Modi government have the courage to do what it takes to protect India’s territorial sovereignty? Only time and the actions of the government will tell., Arup Kumar Ghosh, Howrah, Sir — India has lost 20 soldiers to a war which has not even begun. It remains to be seen if this war can be won diplomatically. The prime minister should stop being ambiguous about the issue. In an all-party meeting, Narendra Modi declared that no intrusion had taken place in the Galwan Valley. How is this believable? If the Chinese troops did not cross the Line of Actual Control how did they kill Indian soldiers? China has already put Modi’s faux pas to good use, claiming that Chinese troops did not make incursions into Indian territory., It is not surprising that truths about the territorial integrity of India and that of other countries are selectively highlighted. The allegedly concocted stories of a surgical strike in Balakot and the Pulwama attack were repeated over and over again to win the 2019 general elections. But this time around, if the truth of China’s military aggression is exposed, people will lose faith in the strongman politics of the Modi government., That China is many times stronger in military might than India is no secret. So coercion cannot be an alternative to sharp-witted diplomacy to subdue China. But India’s diplomatic strength has been eroded away by the current dispensation. India’s economy, too, cannot compete with that of China; goods from our eastern neighbour dominate our markets. Any action against China must thus be taken carefully and judiciously. That China has occupied Indian land in Galwan Valley and reportedly built many underground bunkers there came to light only after the face-off between the troops of the two countries. India was caught napping once, it should not happen again., Rabindranath Sarkar, Calcutta, Sir — Narendra Modi’s hollow rhetoric does not fool anybody anymore. Over the years, the policy missteps of his government have weakened India’s position in the Southeast Asia region. Each time it has snubbed a neighbour — Bangladesh was not happy with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — it has strengthened China’s hand. It is too late to make amends., Md. Iqbal, Satna, Bihar, Sir — Monsoon evenings spent at home were once unimaginable without a hot cup of tea along with an assortment of fritters like beguni, peyaji, phuluri, daler bora or at the very least piping hot singaras. But given the pandemic and the attendant concerns regarding hygiene, few people are ready to risk buying these goodies from street-side stalls. Making these at home is time-consuming and impossible for those already treading a fine line between work and household chores. Even though the entire family is at home, the evening tea is now a rushed affair between shooting off work emails., Dilip Mukherjee, Calcutta\n",

Ms Zargar, who opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, was arrested, as others were, for allegedly having incited the violence in northeast Delhi. Yet three earlier applications for bail on the same grounds had been refused, and on June 22, it had been argued that pregnancy cannot be a ground for bail since there have been 39 deliveries in Tihar jail and Ms Zargar was being given medical care. The humanitarian urge kicked in, mysteriously, the very next day with the bail being granted as the State said that it had no objection to ‘humanitarian’ grounds. The court granted it under strict conditions. But two features stand out. One is the reiteration of the word, humanitarian, every time Ms Zargar’s bail is mentioned, and the other is its sudden dawning. After having registered the kindness of the State — or why harp on it? — it becomes necessary to dig a little deeper.The Supreme Court has indicated, as in the State of Rajasthan versus Balchand for example, that the rule is bail not jail, unless there is a possibility that the accused would flee, alter evidence or intimidate witnesses. That is in line with both the rights to freedom and dignity and the principle that no one is guilty till so proven. Ms Zargar, however, was arrested under the UAPA. The sections in that law which restrict bail refer to terrorist acts or membership of terrorist organizations. Since Ms Zargar is accused of having blocked a road in protest that may have led to violence, “unlawful activities” become remarkably vague: they can mean anything the government does not like. Are the Delhi police not so keen about the high court getting into the details of these charges? Questions there could raise others about the grounds of arrests of all anti-CAA protesters: so, the sudden invocation of humanitarianism is helpful. But experts of the United Nations Human Rights Council have demanded the release of the 11 others arrested for anti-CAA protests, describing these moves of the government as a “chilling” message to its critics. Maybe laws cannot be abused forever.\n",

He is a young poet and activist in Delhi. He is involved in the fight against Modi and his fascist, racist citizenship law. I will read a little bit from one of his poems,\" the musician said, endorsing the anti-CAA protests and criticising the Indian Prime Minister., Waters read:, Kill us, we will become ghosts, And write of your killings, with all the evidence;, You write jokes in court, we will write justice' on the walls;, We will speak so loudly that even the deaf will hear,, We will write so clearly that even the blind will read;, You write injustice on earth, We will write revolution in the sky;, Everything will be remembered, Everything recorded., Amidst cheers, Waters signed off saying “I think this kid’s gotta future.”, Aziz is a writer, actor and musician with a degree in civil engineering. India was introduced to his poem after his impassioned performance of it at the “India, My Valentine” event in Mumbai on February 16. His other song Achhe Din Blues, released last year, has garnered over 200,000 views on YouTube., When citizenry registers dissent, it needs to be registered. It is their democratic right. Not long ago, writer Varun Grover wrote and performed his poem Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge via a twitter video post. His words now constitute what has become an anthem for the anti-CAA-NRC protests raging across the country., \"हम काग़ज़ नहीं दिखाएँगे।\"Inspired by the spirit of every protestor and India-lover. With hat-tips to Rahat Indori saab and the Bangla slogans.(There is no copyright on these words - feel free to use them, adapt, sing, modify, create.) pic.twitter.com/bJZULAAvR8, Waters: Always at the forefront of protest, Waters, who has been extremely vocal about the Israeli occupation of Palestine, is also a member of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in solidarity with Palestinians. It did not matter to him that he lost American Express and Citibank tour sponsorships for his stand in 2016., Canadian-Palestinian spoken word artist and activist Rafeef Ziadah was the media spokesperson for the Coalition in Gaza during the southern Israel cross-border attacks and subsequent bombing of the strip in 2011., As the bombs came down, she was asked by a visiting journalist, “Don’t you think it will all be fine if you just stop teaching your children to hate?” Ziadah wrote and later performed We teach life, Sir in response to that. Ziadah’s piece is regarded as one of the finest examples of the spoken word form of protest., History of protests, Which was the first protest? Was it that time in Babylon, when an incident or series of incidents led Hamurabi to write his code? Or was it that time when tortured slave labour used to construct pyramids deliberately left gaps in the impenetrable structures’ fortification? Or was it that time in 1937, when after decades of the systematic lynching of African-Americans spread far and wide across the states, Lewis Allan (Abel Meeropol) wrote:, “Southern trees, Bear strange fruit, Blood on the leaves, And blood at the roots, Black bodies, Swinging in the southern breeze, Strange fruit hangin', From the poplar trees”?, Or was it that time, persecuted Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet was apprehended by police while waiting for his lover under a tree in a park. He wrote:, “I am a walnut tree in Gulhane Park [...], Neither you are aware of this, nor the police”?, Every protest is a first, because organising dissent is an organic, ever-evolving programmatic. A protest defies forms, structures. One can sing, write, recite, scream as Emma Goldman would have said, “If I can't dance, it's not my revolution!”\n",

We are now contemplating only on changing the government in 2021,” Rawat, who arrived here on Monday, told reporters in the afternoon., Asked about alleged unhappiness about PCC president Ripun Bora among a section within the party, Rawat said, “Many things happen within a family. But the family finds solutions.”, A party source, however, told The Telegraph that there was a likelihood of a rejig of the state leadership soon. “Five states/Union Territories — Assam, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu and Bengal — are going for polls next year. The party is giving special focus on Assam and Kerala, where it has prospects of winning in contrast to the three others where the field will not be smooth,” the source said., There have been reports that while the high command admits Bora’s hard-working ability, at the same time it was not happy with the electoral results under him. The high command is also not happy with Rawat for his alleged failure in stopping factionalism within the party., Rawat will stay in Assam till Thursday. “He will be attending anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests at Mangaldoi, Sipajhar and Nalbari during the three days,” said PCC spokesperson Imdad Hussain., On the reported inter-party rift, Rawat said the Congress was a democratic party. “Every leader has his or her followers. But when election arrives, we will stand together and fight together,” he said., Rawat said the party’s statewide padayatra against CAA will continue till April.\n",

            "op-ed - Scope for more - Telegraph India$ 26.01.20$Words and pictures are not adequate to convey the range of what is unfolding across the country with the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The coverage needed data visualization maps for different points of time to capture the breadth of the movement as it spreads across states and cities.And to deepen our understanding of its geography and timeline. But our journalists are not responding with these techniques as yet., At the turn of the decade the media are in transition across the world. The pithiest description of the change came from the editor in chief of Bloomberg News when he described news as “an industry in transition, not in decline. It is re-emerging as something more digital, more personalized, more automated, more paid for”., The last decade in India has been one of digital proliferation and the growth of both alternative and niche media. But as the number of news sites burgeoned, technology use became more about being found on Google and Facebook and less about tech-enhanced journalism. It became about recommendation technology on websites using bots to both figure out consumer behaviour and direct them to other stories they might want to see. Not so much about machine learning and artificial intelligence producing data-heavy stories at one end of the spectrum. Or about combing vast datasets or combining a range of digital sources to produce an investigative outcome, at the other end., In this period technology has driven enormous change in media consumption. It has become a world of mobile-optimized information and entertainment both here and abroad. Most new journalism ventures, both video and print, are digital; technology has brought pay to digital consumption through paywalls, and also made alternative funding possible via online crowdfunding. The paywalls, incidentally, have become a daily barrier to routine journalistic and other kinds of research, which is something nobody is pointing out., The internet connected up some 500 million people in this country in less than five years through broadband and telephony, and made video ubiquitous. The burgeoning of social media and the advent of WhatsApp made an alternative medium possible for the political class to use and misuse. And the technology to both create and expose fake news was born., Meanwhile, audio, the oldest of communication technologies, became trendy again via the podcast. Podcasts have also become sites of investigative journalism. All in one ten-year period., Technology has led to news overload but did it increase the depth and breadth of news gathered? Or do we just have multiple forums now offering the same level of reporting? In India at this point the latter is the case., But in some newsrooms abroad, data scientists and computer engineers are being hired in increasing numbers because the scale of ambition is different. The New York Times has a research and development team. One of the things the paper did recently was to create a geo-located data layer over the real world which brings alive the levels of air pollution in major cities. If you are reading it in Delhi it uses your location to help you visualize just how bad the city’s air is. Spatial augmented reality enables new forms of data to be visualized physically and in real time., The Washington Post’s chief information officer was in India last year describing how the numbers of both journalists and technical staffers went up substantially after Bezos bought the paper. And they work in tandem. Algorithmic predictions of how an article will perform is used by editors to decide how to promote it across platforms or on different social networks. The choices digital editors make has a lot to do with using metrics. Newsrooms are now expected to roll out multiple headlines for the same story for optimization through audience testing., Separately, one of the things the Post has done recently is to develop a video taxonomy or a “universal language to label manipulated video”. Building on that others are evolving a standard for fact-checking visuals., All technological innovation is not happening in the Western hemisphere. The world leader in personalization is a Chinese company called Toutiao which has an app that uses algorithms to select different content for individual users. It uses natural language processing and computer vision, to extract entities and keywords as features from each piece of content. Machine learning is getting better at understanding Google’s selection of stories., And as for bots writing stories, although the much touted example of this is the Associated Press’s use of automation for writing stories on company results, Toutiao’s artificial intelligence capabilities helped it to turn out stories at speed during the Rio Olympics., In the decade that has begun, the technological shift could mean moving from digital to virtual, from algorithms to artificial intelligence, and then going further to deploy other technologies to enhance journalism., Microsoft News Labs has come up with an AI-driven programme that can search datasets from PDFs and emails to photo and digitized magazine clippings. But even before this, the Panama Papers investigation had used technology to make swathes of data searchable., Additionally, journalism research institutes and organizations like the BBC are now focusing on training in what is called Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) using digital sources on the Web. The range of methodologies used is 3D modelling, audio analysis data mining, remote sensing, photogrammetry, and plain field work. The way forward for an Indian media house with the right kind of ambition would be to partner, as established media outlets abroad have done, with groups like Forensic Architecture and Bellingcat, who have demonstrated the amazing potential of this approach., To investigate and document environmental degradation and pollution, for example — perhaps the biggest challenge for humanity in the immediate future — more and more journalists will need to adopt the techniques and tools of OSINT., Forensic Architecture, for instance, investigated oil and gas pollution at a location in Argentina. A multidisciplinary research group based at the University of London uses architectural techniques and technologies in its investigations., Much of this, of course, has to do with what media outlets consider journalism’s job to be, regardless of what the algorithms are telling us regarding what people want to read about. While videos of all kinds of incidents fly around on WhatsApp, the potential for investigating some of these to nail culpability exists. You only need to have the investigative will and energy to deploy., There are more CCTVs in Indian cities today than ever before. Apart from video-wielding bystanders. Using scraps of video footage with computer-based forensic techniques now available can put the UP police squarely on the mat for recent excesses should anyone wish to attempt it., So far, the media tech story here has been primarily one of enabling alternative journalism, widening access, enabling viability, and only marginally about enhancing journalistic capability. That needs to change., The author is a media commentator and was the founder-editor of TheHoot.org\n",

My tweets in the past too were only about the movements and causes I was working for and not personal publicity,” Kanhaiya told The Telegraph on Thursday., On Wednesday, he had been absent from a news conference held in support of Umar Khalid, who was recently arrested in a Delhi riot case and with whom Kanhaiya had been jailed in 2016 when both were JNU students. It led to murmurs of “ditched by Kanhaiya” at the Press Club of India., But the CPI leader told this newspaper: “The Left has been clear that the police probe is a sham. It has protested (to press) for the prosecution of BJP leaders (who made incendiary speeches ahead of the February riots) from Day 1., “Yet why am I being personally held accountable for not attending a press conference? Are such questions asked of members of other Opposition parties?”, He added: “I’m being cursed whether or not (I do something), and a false binary is being created by some over (the act of) speaking about one political prisoner more than the other. We have been fighting for the release of all political prisoners, be it Sudha Bharadwaj or Anand Teltumbde or Umar.”, Kanhaiya said he couldn’t attend the news conference, held to protest the arrests of anti-CAA activists on terror charges in connection with the Delhi riots, because he had been held up at an MP’s home over a meeting related to the upcoming Bihar elections., Now a member of the CPI’s national executive, Kanhaiya has been a rage on social media for his satirical comments targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his government’s failures and the alleged crimes of the BJP-RSS., But his social media accounts had been silent since the end of July. On Wednesday, he broke the silence with a long Facebook post on the media trial of political prisoners like Umar amid the havoc the pandemic has unleashed in the country., His comment boxes are now filled with jibes about his waking up after a “long slumber”, and questions about why he has chosen to speak out now and where he was when his “karmabhoomi” (workplace) Bihar was ravaged by floods., Kanhaiya told this newspaper that he had come to Delhi on March 15 to consult lawyers for the first hearing of his sedition trial, which was expected to begin in April. He has stayed mostly in Ajoy Bhawan, the CPI headquarters., Since then Covid-19 has claimed his uncle, a former teacher he was close to, and the CPI’s Bihar state secretary Satyanarayan Singh, a father figure to Kanhaiya., Four members of Kanhaiya’s family have been infected. The parents of three close friends have died from Covid-19, including one whose passing was communicated to him while he was speaking to this newspaper., “I couldn’t go to their cremation because of the lockdown. This entire time I have been on the phone trying to connect people in need to our comrades and others who could help… I’m not in the frame of mind to tweet satire,” Kanhaiya said., “I can’t even go home as we have a one-room house, where I would be putting my aged mother at risk. In Bihar, more than 50 people travel with me because we are always at risk of being attacked. I can’t do that now as I can’t put the families of these people at the risk of exposure to Covid.”, He continued: “We don’t have a huge organisation, neither am I from a rich family. Yet we have tried to help whoever we can, with people sitting in Delhi, Patna and Begusarai coordinating with people across India., “We have arranged for 13,000 workers to be fed by the All India Trade Union Congress (of the CPI) in Coimbatore. We have fed artistes who were hungry for three days, given ration kits and clothes to flood-hit families in Bihar. There are good journalists out of work who can’t pay rent. We’ve tried to help them too., “Not just the CPI comrades but many others helped us, including an MP and an MLA from the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi. After the lockdown was relaxed, I have travelled to five states in the north for both relief and political work.”, Kanhaiya said he was now focused on poll-bound Bihar although he would not contest., “I will be moving to Patna where I shall do whatever election work the party gives me. We need a narrative that speaks of livelihood issues and breaks this discourse of Hindus versus Muslims,” he said., “The BJP must be defeated in the state that has the highest number of migrant workers. People who question my commitment because I don’t want to contest should be concerned more with how we need to build unity among the Opposition parties.”\n",

            "fifth-column - Plug the gaps: Aadhar and MGNREGA - Telegraph India$ 18.09.20$India’s economy is going through an unprecedented crisis of unemployment. In these times, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme and other welfare programmes are beacons of hope for India’s large rural population. However, the delivery of welfare has traditionally suffered from leakages. Thus, in 2015-16, the Government of India started linking these programmes with the Aadhaar — ostensibly to reduce leakages by deleting duplicate, fake or ghost beneficiaries. According to the GoI, till December 2019, this verification and deletion led to savings of Rs 24,162.09 crore in MGNREGA alone., But this linkage with Aadhaar involves a trade-off — the effort to reduce leakages can result in the exclusion of genuine beneficiaries. What has been the overall impact of this linking process? We sought this answer through a recent study of MGNREGA in Jharkhand supported by the Digital Identity Research Initiative at the Indian School of Business. We surveyed 2,907 workers in eight villages, three blocks and three districts of Jharkhand from May 2019 to February 2020. In our sample, the job cards of over 40 per cent of the workers had been deleted., The study revealed some shocking findings. Out of the cards that were deleted, 57 per cent belonged to genuine workers who were alive, living in the village, without any other job card, and willing to do manual work under MGNREGA. In fact, 48 per cent said they were keen on working and wanted their job cards renewed (many of the remaining had already got new job cards made). Finally, nearly 85 per cent of the workers whose job cards were deleted were not even aware of it — they were never informed, let alone asked for consent, before their job cards were deleted. , Out of the 1.22 crore workers registered under MGNREGA in Jharkhand, 35.15 lakh were deleted by July 2020. Since 57 per cent of these belonged to genuine workers, more than 20 lakh of the valid job cards were deleted. This is more than the combined population of three districts of Lohardaga, Khunti and Simdega in Jharkhand. The increase in exclusion error (excluding genuine workers) is clearly higher than the reduction in inclusion errors (including non-genuine workers). Further, the benefits from the deletion of non-eligible job cards are uncertain since having a job card does not mean money is being spent on it — one needs to show work to get paid. Conversely, the cost of deletion of eligible beneficiaries could be massive; workers who are denied the right to work were unable to access work when they most needed it., The question is why were so many job cards deleted? While deleting a worker’s job card, the official is supposed to choose a reason from various options such as ‘Fake Job Card’, ‘Family Shifted’, ‘Duplicate Applicant’ and so on. Yet, the most common reason mentioned is “Others” (in 62 per cent of the cases where job cards were incorrectly deleted). According to a government official, this mass and erroneous deletion of job cards happened owing to the pressure to achieve 100 per cent Aadhaar linkage within a stipulated time. Strikingly, during our survey, we found that people whose job cards were incorrectly deleted were mostly those from the marginalized and remote communities that depend most on MGNREGA. For instance, in Palamu, we found a remote hamlet of people belonging to particularly vulnerable tribal groups where job cards of nearly all residents were incorrectly deleted., If the bureaucracy can make such errors in a simple exercise of matching job cards to Aadhaar cards, imagine the errors that can be expected from a mammoth exercise like the NPR or the NRC. If we extrapolate these error percentages, exclusion errors of 22.43 per cent would imply 30.3 crore Indians with proper documents would be denied citizenship simply owing to bureaucratic errors. While we strive to reduce leakages, it is important that we also strive to reduce exclusions. Given the importance of MGNREGA today, these exclusions must be addressed immediately so that the most marginalized people are able to avail of their right to work and live with dignity.\n",

It’s a conspiracy to let off those against whom unimpeachable evidence is available to show their involvement in these riots.”, The media conference was held hours before the police announced that they had filed the first chargesheet on an FIR in which rights activist Umar Khalid, who was arrested on Sunday night, and several student and youth activists as well as former municipal councillors of the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress, Taahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan, have been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. The 11-volume, 17,000-page chargesheet was submitted in court in a steel trunk., Khalid’s parents were present at the media conference but did not speak., His mother Sabiha Khanum wore a facemask with her son’s picture on it with the message “We are all Umar Khalid” written in Hindi., Several of those present held placards, each bearing the picture of an accused booked under the UAPA with the name suffixed to the writing “We are all”., They also issued a statement demanding the release of the accused and the arrest of BJP leaders who had made incendiary speeches before the riots., A video message recorded by Khalid just before his arrest was screened in which he said: “The Delhi police are not arresting the rioters who incited and caused the large-scale communal violence in the capital in February. Instead, it is going after those who criticise the government and its policies, especially the Citizenship Amendment Act. The ones who participated in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests are being wrongly framed without proof.”, CPI national council member Kanhaiya Kumar, who had been arrested along with Khalid and fellow JNU student Anirban Bhattacharya for sedition in 2016 for which they are yet to face trial, was listed as a speaker at Wednesday’s media conference but he did not turn up, ostensibly because he was stuck in another meeting., Kanhaiya wrote on Facebook: “The question is why have the BJP leaders who openly instigated the riots not been called for questioning and arrested? Questions being raised on the investigation into the Delhi riots are inevitable as the aim is not to ensure justice but to take political revenge.”, Friends of Khalid said the police’s special cell had allowed books to be given to him in custody. He is currently said to be reading Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy., Artist Shuddhabrata Sengupta has gifted Khalid a copy of Christopher de Bellaigue’s The Islamic Enlightenment: The Struggle Between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times, which will be handed over to the police through Khalid’s lawyer Trideep Pais., Former Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed said at the media conference: “The objective of the government is to target Muslims along with other marginalised and deprived sections. The idea is to finish off our composite culture. We’re running at great speed towards a theocratic state. It is up to us to decide what kind of a country we want.”, Several speakers drew comparisons between the Centre’s legal offensive against the anti-CAA activists and the misery of people due to the lockdown. CPIML politburo member Kavita Krishnan referred to the police citing voluminous documents while seeking Khalid’s custody and said: “This government has 11 lakh pages against Umar but not one page on the deaths of migrants. This shows their priority.… Delhi police must introspect whether they want to be remembered as a private army of the powers that be.”\n",

They had even put (CPM general-secretary) Yechury’s name in the charge-sheet…. Even (Swaraj India chief) Yogendra Yadav and others, their names,” said Mamata., “What happened in the Delhi riots, when they happened, everyone knew what was up. Had Covid-19 not taken centre-stage soon after, it would have all come to light…. Against the NRC, NPR, CAA, those who protested, they were targeted for violent turmoil…. It is not correct in a democracy.”, The Trinamul Congress chief, who had in the past called the Delhi riots a “planned, state-sponsored genocide” that was deliberately painted in a communal colour later, had said the buck had to stop with Union home minister Amit Shah., On Monday, she said the law and its processes had to be adhered to. “If somebody is wrong, if there is evidence, then there should be action. But if somebody hasn’t done anything wrong…. Whatever is correct according to the law, must be done. Whatever is not correct according to the law, it must not be done. That’s it,” said Mamata., She then went on to bring up the BJP’s alleged activities in Bengal., “See here now, every day, what they do all day, with nothing but fake news?, Even going to the extent of saying Covid-19 is over, so conducting political meetings is okay…”, “Now they won’t even give Covid-19 priority,” the chief minister said, referring to a recent assertion by BJP state unit chief Dilip Ghosh., “What more will they do? They are a party that only considers itself right and everybody else liars. This is just not correct,” she added.\n",

In today’s India, payback is only reserved to our own citizens, never against countries who actually question and challenge our sovereignty.”, Historian Audrey Truschke tweeted a link to a BBC report on the arrest and said: “Everyone — not only those of us who follow the Indian news — should read about this appalling arrest. It can (and, depending on November) will happen in the United States too.”, The CPM politburo condemned the arrest, which came soon after the name of its general secretary Sitaram Yechury was mentioned in a supplementary chargesheet on the riots along with Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, academics Jayati Ghosh and Apoorvanand Jha, and filmmaker Rahul Roy., Roy and his wife Saba Dewan were on Monday questioned by the police’s counter-terror unit in the same building where Khalid is being held., The couple had organised several protests under the “Not In My Name” banner against the lynchings of Muslims and other crimes against humanity over the past five years., A former JNU student, Khalid already faces a sedition case for organising a “cultural evening” in 2016 during which slogans for Kashmiri independence were allegedly raised. The trial is yet to begin., Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh said: “The Delhi riots were orchestrated by the BJP and its leaders and they should be arrested. There’s enough proof of this. The big question is, how will the BJP’s police do justice?”, The riot probe has been called a “witch-hunt” in a statement by several activists, artists and academics including CPM politburo member Brinda Karat, CPIML Liberation politburo member Kavita Krishnan, Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, former Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed, author Arundhati Roy, musician T.M. Krishna, historian Ramachandra Guha, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan and public policy expert Biraj Patnaik., “With deep anguish we have no doubt in saying that this investigation is not about the violence in February 2020 in the national capital, but on the completely peaceful and democratic protests across the country against the unconstitutional CAA,” they said., “The right to life is not just to be allowed to eat, live and breathe; it is to live without fear, with dignity and with freedom of expression, including dissent. The nature of investigation has been mainly to silence democratic voices and instil fear, and this is precisely the objective of this witch-hunt.”, Khalid had complained to police commissioner S.N. Srivastava earlier this month that the police were asking his acquaintances to falsely implicate him or face arrest., Nine senior retired IPS officers — Shafi Alam, K. Saleem Ali, Mohinderpal Aulakh, A.S. Dulat, Aloke B. Lal, Amitabh Mathur, Avinash Mohanney, P.G.J. Nampoothiri and A.K. Samanta — have written to Srivastava endorsing what retired “supercop” Julio Ribeiro had told the commissioner last week., Referring to the riot probe, former DGP Ribeiro had asked Srivastava to examine whether officers under his command “have been true to their oath”., The Delhi police have said they are checking the veracity of Ribeiro’s email., Without mentioning the names of the accused in the riots cases, the nine retired cops said: “Mr Julio Ribeiro is a living legend of an IPS officer (as one publication put it).... We would like to endorse the letter he has written to you regarding the flawed investigation into the Delhi riots…., “In addition, we would like to say that it indeed is a sad day in the history of Indian police that investigations and challans submitted in the court by Delhi police in connection with riots of this year are widely believed to be partisan and politically motivated. It pains all those police officers, serving as well as retired, who believe in upholding the rule of law and our Constitution.”, They added: “Such investigation will only make people lose faith in democracy, justice, fairness and the Constitution.... We would, therefore, earnestly request you for reinvestigation of all riot cases fairly and without any bias.”, Celebrated Malayalam filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, poets K. Satchidanandan and Manglesh Dabral, artist Vivan Sundaram, dramatist Maya Rao and several others have spoken out against the arrest of Kabir Kala Manch activists in the Elgaar Parishad case., “The state is attempting to silence the radical Bahujan cultural expressions like that of the KKM. This is an attempt to stop those trying to envision a just future for India,” they said in a statement., “We condemn the attempt to stifle the voices of cultural dissent, and stand in solidarity with the arrested KKM activists, and all others who have been incarcerated in the Bhima Koregaon case.”, Last week, the National Investigation Agency arrested Marathi folk artistes Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor and Jyoti Jagtap for “propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology” along with other people in connection with an alleged Maoist plot to infiltrate an Ambedkarite event in 2017 and incite violence., All three were stage performers for the KKM, a cultural group listed by the home ministry in 2011 as a Maoist front.\n",

            "editorial - Secure law: The National Security Act - Telegraph India$ 15.09.20$The value of a law depends on its application. The National Security Act, 1980 permits preventive detention — up to a maximum of 12 months — “in certain cases and for matters connected therewith”. These “certain cases” are fleshed out to indicate that a person can be detained, among other reasons, to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of India and the maintenance of public order. This is rather imprecise: public order remains subject to the State’s interpretation, and the security of India could be made to mean the security of the ruling regime and its agenda. Recently, after the release of the doctor, Kafeel Khan, by the Allahabad High Court which reportedly criticized the authorities for booking him under the NSA on a whim, legal experts have spoken up against the indiscriminate use of this law. They feel that states should not use the law without reasonable material to justify its application, and police officers using it wrongfully should be penalized. Although successive governments have misused the NSA from time to time, its application has become almost a daily practice under the present dispensation. From dumping cow carcasses to protesting against the lack of Covid-19 testing at airports, the NSA is slapped for anything that strikes the State’s fancy. Experts feel that the law is being used to punish, not prevent, because people can be locked in jail for 12 months although most cases, like Mr Khan’s, would not pass legal scrutiny., Uttar Pradesh leads in the intimidating and arbitrary use of the NSA. While 13 arrests under it this year have been of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters — they evidently threaten security, even if not the country’s — 76 of 139 NSA arrests till August 19 were of those accused of cow slaughter. They allegedly threaten public order, because the accusation of killing cows is a ‘sensitive’ matter. This use of the NSA upends all notions of justice and fair process. It is telling that of the thousands of arrests under other laws for cow slaughter in UP, the police have filed closure reports for only 32 on account of the lack of sufficient evidence. But the NSA can enforce a 12-month stay in prison. Deliberately misused, it is a handy tool in the art of creating fear.\n",

He was also quizzed by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police earlier regarding an alleged conspiracy behind the riots., His mobile phone was also seized by the police., As citizens deeply committed to constitutional values, we condemn the arrest of Umar Khalid who has been subjected to a malicious investigation targeting peaceful anti-CAA protestors,” the statement by the group of academics, lawyers and rights activists said, The Wire reported., With deep anguish we have no doubt in saying that this investigation is not about the violence in February 2020 in the national capital, but on the completely peaceful and democratic protests across the country against the unconstitutional CAA,” the statement said., It described Khalid as “one of the hundreds of voices that spoke up in favour of the Constitution across the country during these anti-CAA protests, always foregrounding the need for peaceful, non-violent and democratic means”., The statement also noted that Khalid had emerged as a strong and powerful voice of young Indians in “favour of the Constitution and of democracy.”, Among those who signed the statement are Ravi Kiran Jain and V.

In their attempt to prevent violence, 108 police personnel received injuries and two died., The Delhi Police on Sunday said it was investigating the role of all individuals who allegedly took part in the riots and were part of a larger conspiracy in organising violence in the northeast Delhi and inciting communal passion and hatred amongst communities, an official statement, reported by PTI, stated., Delhi Police said they had registered 751 FIRs in connection with the riots that took place in the last week of February this year. As far as the investigation is concerned Delhi Police had carried it out meticulously in the most professional manner, officials said., After collecting and collating all evidence, the investigation has been finalised in most of the important cases and the charge sheets have been submitted in the court for trial, the police also said, adding the riots also caused large-scale damage to both private and public properties., So far, police have arrested 1,575 people in 751 cases.

            "hindutva - The root of the poison: Indian Islamophobia - Telegraph India$ 14.09.20$India has witnessed growing violence against Muslims under the current regime, including mob-lynchings and the recent attempt of exclusion through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Much of this is being countered through a critique of growing Islamophobia by the secular-democratic forces. Islamophobia refers to fear of and hatred for Muslims without reason or evidence. It is animosity not just against Muslims but also Islam as a religion. Islamophobia is considered to be xenophobic in nature and has the potential of triggering episodic and organized violence against religious minorities., However, confronting growing religious polarization through the narrative of Islamophobia could be counter-productive. Islamophobia has become all-pervasive and natural. The proponents of Hindutva wish to institutionalize it. What India has is organized communalism and not Islamophobia. The rightwing wishes to convert communalism into Islamophobia. Communalism, as opposed to Islamophobia, is not based on imagined hatred and visceral exclusion of religious minorities. It is linked to issues of history, memory, social location and economic activities. For instance, communalism in India is linked to the ‘Two Nation theory’ and the history of Partition. It is associated with the selective memory of violence perpetrated by Muslims as well as cultural prejudices against religious minorities. There is also, possibly, an element of economic exploitation where Muslims own land and the labour force comprises Dalits and other Hindus from lower castes. These are real-time conflicts of interest and cultural differences between communities that cannot quite be captured through the narrative of Islamophobia that is predicated on an unreasonable and irrational hatred on the part of the majority community., What is intriguing is that Hindutva majoritarianism precisely wishes to move beyond the complexity and selective rendering of history to an irrational hatred of Muslims. Such irrational hatred can finally unlock the majoritarian project and find hegemonic justification for the xenophobic exclusion of religious minorities. It can make hatred natural and universal. Violence would then not have to depend on organized riots but can be perpetrated ‘naturally’ or spontaneously. It does not have to be ‘imported’ like the way it was in the recent riots in Delhi, as the evidence from various fact-finding reports suggests., The discourse of growing Islamophobia concedes that hatred against Muslims in India is rampant and institutionalized. But the reality is what we have in India is ‘contextual communalism’ that is linked to local history and memory of violence between communities in the past and contemporary cultural differences that lead to claims and counter-claims of religious superiority. For instance, in Bengal, the memory of Partition plays a fundamental role. In Telangana, it has to do with the history of the rule by the Nizam and the violence perpetrated by his private militia, the razakars. What is unreasonable is not the claim of violence but its interpretation. In Bengal, both Hindus and Muslims suffered violence. In Telangana, the razakars were supported by Hindu landlords because it was the Nizam who had granted them the right to land and taxation to counter the armed struggle led by communists. What the sangh parivar does is offer a selective rendering of history that can propel the consolidation of a majoritarian Hindu identity. Majoritarianism can be consolidated only when one moves away from identifying the authentic sources of violence., Intriguingly, even the secular forces often fail to make a distinction between communalism and Islamophobia. What exists in India, as I see it, is communalism. What Hindutva wishes to achieve is the conversion of an insidious communalism into rampant Islamophobia. By collapsing the two categories, the secular-democratic forces, willy-nilly, accept that there is rampant, irrational and unfounded hatred towards not just Muslims but Islam as a religion. This is far from the truth. Even the worst among the bigots do not abuse the prophet but merely hate Muslims. They would agree that all religions are paths to truth but that the Muslims betray it. What Hindutva wishes to generate is hatred for Islam as a religion to rule out the possibility of any kind of cohabitation. This vision is inherently violent and expansionist and does not corroborate with the everyday experience of a majority of Hindus., Even those sympathetic to the project of Hindutva often argue that not all Muslims are bad. Many of them would concede that they know Muslims who are good and helpful. But they would also argue that Muslims have been associated with violence in the course of history. This association is what the Hindutva ecosystem depends on as a legitimate entry point to its project. It can be argued that even though the rightwing in India has succeeded in converting communalism into Islamophobia to some extent, it is nowhere close to achieving a complete consensus., Instead of taking recourse to Islamophobia, which, by default, is in denial of history and culture as they exist, secular-democratic forces need to re-focus on the roots of communalism and look for means of burying the memories of violence between religious communities in the past and resist it in the present. The sangh parivar undermines history to distort it. Secular forces cannot undermine it because they find it difficult to negotiate with its complexity and in doing so they might have already conceded the legitimacy of converting communalism into Islamophobia.\n",

If they don't leave their homes, how will they showcase their strength?”, Her fight against the Citizenship Amendment Act had already led to her being included in Time magazine’s Time 100 most influential people in 2020 published in September., In spite of spontaneous protests breaking out in several parts of the country, the Prime Minister, who had said in December that those setting the fire can be identified by their clothes, has done little to resolve the CAA issue. , Covid-19 prompted the protesters to suspend their agitation but BJP leaders such as Amit Shah occasionally rake up the new citizenship regime., There is one other Indian on the BBC list – Manasi Joshi, the current para-badminton world champion.

Now we are again contacting the Prime Minister’s Office,” said Santanu Thakur, the BJP MP of Bongaon., The Matua Mahasangha raised the demand for implementation of the CAA as its leaders have been facing embarrassing questions from the community on whether the Act, billed by the saffron camp as a one-stop solution for citizenship issues faced by Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, would be implemented or stay on paper., On Thursday, Bongaon MP Santanu, with his brother Subrata, held a meeting in Nadia’s Bogula to reassert the demand for the rollout of the Act before some 10,000 members of the Matua community., Santanu earlier this year had written to home minister Amit Shah for an early implementation of the CAA., What could further embarrass the BJP is the Matua Mahasangha’s decision to launch a pan-Bengal campaign for the implementation of CAA. The Mahasangha will hold over a dozen meetings in south and north Bengal districts covering some 10 Lok Sabha seats., “The CAA was used as a major plank by the BJP to win over Matua voters in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls...the party won both the Bongaon and Ranaghat parliamentary seats (with a significant Matua population). Now, people want its implementation,” said an insider in the Mahasangha., The Mahasangha’s move comes close on the heels of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent outreach bids, such as the Matua Development Board with a grant of Rs 10 crore and pattas for Matuas to ensure their land rights, a move she said would eventually benefit 1.25 lakh families., At the Mahasangha rally, Santanu said only the CAA could solve the problem of refugees. “Some people are misleading refugees by offering patta, but that can never ensure them citizenship. We want the Centre to take initiative to implement CAA fast,” he said.  “The delay has made people restless,” he added., Mukutmani Adhikari, the Mahasangha’s Nadia south committee president, said a large number of community members are frustrated over the delay in implementing the CAA. “It has become tough for us to answer their questions on the issue. The promise to implement the CAA had helped the BJP win seats in Matua-dominated areas in the 2019 polls. The delay has embarrassed us. The Centre should announce when the process for implementation will happen.”, Adhikari added that it would be difficult to hold back the support base if the CAA is delayed “since political rivals can misinterpret and misguide the Matuas”.\n",

For those convinced that humanism informs all moral judgment of humans, the ways of nationalism can often be counter-intuitive. Nowhere was this starker than in the results of the November 8 elections to Myanmar’s bicameral national assemblies as well as its 14 state assemblies. The ruling National League for Democracy, led by the de facto head of government and the state chancellor, Aung San Suu Kyi — the Nobel peace laureate much vilified in the Western world now for her defence of the military action against Rohingyas — returned with a landslide larger than the historic victory in 2015., The NLD now commands absolute majority in the bicameral national assembly, together known as the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw. The two Houses are the Pyithu Hluttaw (lower House) and the Amyotha Hluttaw (upper House). Then there are the 14 sub-national Hluttaws, corresponding to the country’s seven ethnic states and seven regions. By the 2008 Constitution, 25 per cent of seats in all the Hluttaws are reserved for the military. The NLD’s main opponent, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, together with its 23 allies in the 93-party fray, has been pushed further to the margins from the roughly 10 per cent representation won in 2015., Few ever doubted that the NLD would be coming out on top. However, the cautious popular prepoll verdict was that the NLD would emerge as single largest party but would have to seek alliance partners to form the next government, and that the pound of flesh for such a compromise would be expensive. These predictions are now in history’s dustbin., Obviously, nationalism cannot be read on a conventional moral scale, and is also generally a majoritarian enterprise. When Suu Kyi formally defended Myanmar military’s alleged genocidal campaign against the Rohingyas at the International Court of Justice in December 2019, she was treated as a pariah by much of the Western world but in her own country, especially amongst the majority Bamar population, under a sense of siege from international scrutiny, respect for her only deepened. The failure of most to see this is despite the emerging pattern of ultranationalism all over the world, including India. At all these places, conventional morality is being thrown to the wind not just by political parties but also by larger sections of their populations. Indeed, Myanmar’s Rohingya problem should remind India of its own painful tussle over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act., The November 2020 elections also belied another expectation. The ethnic states were predicted to drift further away from the mainstream and ethnic political parties, it was believed, would consolidate as a block, or blocks, outside of the NLD to become kingmakers. Quite to the contrary, the NLD has made inroads into the states as well, and if the NLD wishes, it can foist its own governments given the fact that the 2008 Constitution leaves it to the national government, and not the winners of contests in the local arenas, to form state governments. Many think this victory by the first-past-the-post system may be deceptive, for though losing out on the number of seats, support bases of these bested ethnic parties can still be very large. Therefore, their alienation can still mean big trouble for the militancy-torn country. The challenge before Suu Kyi is to acknowledge this and go for what peace scholars like John Paul Lederach have called the “Moral Imagination”, which rests on the belief that a sincere handshake can often resolve conflicts better than legal treaties or victories. Despite its super majority, the hope among many then is that the NLD would still strive to partner with ethnic parties., How did Myanmar come to be in this state of chaos? The jurist, A.G. Noorani, in his India-China Boundary Problem, may have provided an answer by differentiating between the nature of decolonization of India and Myanmar. In the case of India, it was a transfer of power, and India retained all existing institutions of governance to maintain continuity and then modify at will and leisure. In Myanmar, it was simply an end of the paramountcy of the British, leaving the country to begin institution-building from scratch, throwing it into turmoil. Shelby Tucker’s profile of this chaos in Burma: The Curse of Independence is convincing. Apart from radical ethnic unrests and a plummeting economy, the country was also being taken for granted by foreign powers. With CIA patronage, two army divisions of the Chinese nationalist, Koumintang, had even retreated into Myanmar in their fight against Mao’s communist regime. The apprehension of the nation falling apart was so intense that even the 1962 military coup was welcomed by the people, thinking it would be temporary. Power, however, works differently, and those who wield it have seldom relinquished it willingly, and Myanmar’s military regime lasted five decades. Myanmar’s struggle then is still about building trusted institutions of governance., The author is editor, Imphal Review of Arts and Politics\n",

            "Supreme Court of India - Shaheen protesters at Supreme Court door - Telegraph India$ 17.11.20$A group of people who were among the Shaheen Bagh protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 on Monday urged the Supreme Court to review its judgment of October 7 that such protests can be held only at “designated” areas, arguing that such a direction will “lead to abuse of authority by the government”., “Prima facie the observations of this Hon’ble Court in the order under review appear to be giving way to an unrestricted sanction to the police to take action by misusing these observations. This is all the more troublesome when the police has in the recent past acted arbitrarily by beating students and protesters. The above observations, it is submitted, have clothed the police with an arbitrary discretion to attack any peaceful protester,” the review petition, which is yet to be listed for hearing, stated., According to the petition, the only way for citizens in a democracy to show their dissent towards legislations, policies and other governmental acts and omissions is by way of peaceful protests. So to put any kind of curb on this freedom to show dissent leaves the citizens with no resort whatsoever to voice their concerns., “…Propositions like holding protests at ‘designated places alone’ coming from judicial pronouncements shall upset the very concept of dissent and protest. In case of administrative action coming up with such propositions, the citizens still may approach the courts of law. However, in the present situation, the citizens are vulnerable and helpless. This is an obvious error on the face of it which requires review,” the petition said., According to the petitioners, the impugned judgment also sought to vest extraordinary powers on the police and political representatives to hold negotiations with the protesters which it said would be counter-productive as the authorities would never go against government’s policies., “Protests of this nature ought not to be subjected to the atrocities at the hands of a muscular administration which has targeted vulnerable citizens of this country wherever any peaceful protest have become politically inconvenient to the elected representatives in power., “In a liberal democracy, questions of serious importance such as the threat to a person’s citizenship cannot be confined to the mercy of political representatives without the protesters having a reasonable choice of location to protest so that their voice may be heard effectively,” the protesters in their joint petition said., The petitioners submitted that the impugned judgment is contrary to a 1972 five-judge constitution bench ruling in  the Himat Lal Shah case that there cannot be any excessive restrictions on public protests in a democracy., It quoted paragraph 70 of the said constitution bench judgment wherein it was observed: “Public meeting in open spaces and public streets forms part of the tradition of our national life. In the pre-Independence days such meetings have been held in open space and public streets and the people have come to regard it as a part of their privileges and immunities. The State and the local authority have a virtual monopoly of every open space at which an outdoor meeting can be held. If therefore, the State or municipality can constitutionally close both its streets and its parks entirely to public meetings, the practical result would be that it would be impossible to hold any open-air meetings in any large city… streets., “…Public parks existing primarily for other purposes and the social interests promoted by untrammeled exercise of freedom of utterance and assembly in public street must yield to social interest which prohibition and regulation of speech are designed to protect. But there is a constitutional difference between reasonable regulation and arbitrary exclusions…”, Hence it urged the apex court to review its recent judgment.\n",

Its joining the protests could become a major concern for the BJP-led state government., With the slogan Dexotkoi sakori dangor nohoy (job is not greater than the country), SAKP was one of the key supporters of AASU's six-year anti-foreigners movement.

Present were these states’ chief ministers — Sarbananda Sonowal, Pema Khandu and Conrad Sangma — and Union minister Kiren Rijiju, who is from Arunachal., “The Centre is rattled after the NRC scare resulted in defeats for the BJP on Thursday in all the three Assembly by-elections in Bengal. The meeting was called to allay the Northeast’s fears over the proposed citizenship bill,” a home ministry official said., The NRC and the citizenship bill are two sides of the same coin. While the NRC update — which Shah has threatened to carry out nationwide — attempts to identify illegal immigrants, particularly those from Bangladesh, the bill seeks to shield non-Muslim immigrants from detention or deportation., By amending the Citizenship Act of 1955, the proposed bill seeks to grant across-the-board citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan even if they cannot furnish the necessary documents. The bill is a BJP poll promise., While the NRC has prompted fears in Bengal about large-scale detentions and deportations, the bill has raised apprehensions in the Northeast that it will nullify provisions of the 1985 Assam Accord that says all immigrants who arrived after March 24, 1971, are illegal aliens irrespective of religion., On Friday, 12 non-BJP parliamentarians from the Northeast had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to exclude the northeastern states from the ambit of the proposed bill. They said that enforcement of the amendment in the region would leave its tribal population vulnerable to displacement., Early in November, hundreds of students had hit the streets in Arunachal against the Centre’s plan to apply the bill to the Northeast. The protest was organised by the All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union under the banner of the North East Students’ Organisation, a conglomeration of several student bodies of the region., The Congress, Trinamul, CPM and several other political parties have steadfastly opposed the proposed bill, saying citizenship cannot be granted on the basis of religion., The previous Narendra Modi government had got the bill passed in the Lok Sabha but did not introduce it in the Rajya Sabha, apparently because of pressure from the Northeast.

Since the update is complete, we must make it public,” he said., Sarma said the AG had submitted his report in 16 points. “Prima facie it amounts to huge anomalies.”, Sarma said as no one had informed the Supreme Court about the financial anomalies, the court had thought that Hajela was doing fine. “We will now expose his (Hajela) character in the Assembly on December 4 or 5,” Sarma said outside the Assembly on the first day of the winter session., Sarma claimed Hajela had “done mistakes on mistakes”., While the Opposition legislators on Thursday staged a walkout opposing any move to scrap the final NRC published in Assam on August 31, Sarma said nobody could accept the register in its present form., Union home minister Amit Shah recently told Parliament that there would be a nationwide NRC update, including in Assam, triggering mixed reactions in the state. While political parties like the Congress and the AIUDF have opposed scrapping the Assam NRC, the BJP and Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the NRC case, have welcomed it., Following a Supreme Court direction, the Assam government recently transferred Hajela to his home state of Madhya Pradesh on deputation for three years. However, criticism from the BJP against Hajela that began after publication of the final NRC, seem unlikely to go away., Sarma on Thursday reiterated that Assam should be part of the countrywide NRC with the same cut-off date as the rest of the country. “This cut-off date may be 1951, 1961 or 1971. It can be even 1931. It should be same as the rest of the country. But it cannot be after 1971,” he said. , Asked what will happen to the Assam Accord (which sets 1971 as the cut-off date), if the cut-off is made 1951, Sarma said, “Those who had signed the Assam Accord are responsible for it. I am not. It was not signed after taking a consensus at Judges Field. Prafulla Kumar Mahanta had signed the Accord. He is responsible for that. I did not sign it. I am not responsible for it.” , He said even the Assembly had not approved the Accord so far. Hajela could not be contacted for his reaction.\n",

He also called for a reparation model instead of monetary compensation for the victims’ families, especially for widows and young girls., The Karwan-e-Mohabbat (Caravan of Love) team comprising Mander, journalist-turned-peace activist John Dayal and Barpeta-based independent social researcher Abdul Kalam Azad met the families of the five men who were shot dead by suspected Ulfa (Independent) militants in this village near Dhola-Sadiya bridge in Tinsukia district on November 1., The team, besides offering solace and emotional support to the family members, said they have a commitment to evaluate and assess what can be done for them., “Wherever we go, it is never a parachute visit. We have a commitment to evaluate what can be done for the victims’ families here. What we have observed while interacting with the families is that we have to create a local community support system with trained and informed people. Then we have to help them deal with their grief and loss. There are widows and young girls who have lost their loved ones and their fear can be assuaged by trained care workers,” Mander said., The team also said the monetary compensation of Rs 5 lakh offered to the families is not a permanent solution, especially when survivors are single women and widows. “When a lump sum is given all at once, it creates more vulnerabilities for women, especially widows. There could be pressure on her to extract the money as we have seen in a large number of cases. We need to think of financial support on a monthly basis rather than a one-time grant,” he said., The Karwan-e-Mohabbat initiative began in September 2017 after several cases of hate crimes and lynching were reported across the country. , It set out from Nagaon in Assam on September 4 and concluded its journey on October 2 in Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi. , During that phase, the team travelled to eight states meeting families of hate crime victims.

Among the 30 students, seven who know the local dialect are LLM students, who also have been enrolled as lawyers. They have been helping us. The paralegal programme of ICLU will be expanded across India so that every attendee is trained under practising Supreme Court lawyers. They will have practical knowledge about court proceedings and can help others with their knowledge, training and research on the NRC.” , Tanwir said ICLU would act as an organisation that helps in litigation and provides assistance to people in filing appeals to the foreigners tribunals. “Our efforts are a mere drop in the ocean, and much more is needed to be done. We all need to come together and make every effort to ensure a fair process is followed in the determination of citizenship status.”, Tanwir said: “People trained by ICLU will have the opportunity to help hundreds of people who have lost their rights or have been disenfranchised.” Tanwir said currently they wanted to ensure that every person is able to file an effective appeal before the foreigners tribunals in Assam. , “In a number of cases, children born to single mothers or victims of polygamy were not mentioned in the family tree. This led to the exclusion of even little children from the final NRC and making them vulnerable to ‘detention’. This is why ICLU is committed to providing justice,” Tanwir added. \n",

Altogether 68 lakh families have submitted forms with 6.5 crore documents to include their names in the updated NRC., Gogoi today said those whose names were included in the voter list of 2014 were incorporated on the basis of 1966 rolls., Therefore, the voters of 2014 should be automatically included in the NRC, he said., PCC general secretary Bobbeeta Sarmah told The Telegraph, \"The stand of the Congress is clear like the All Assam Students' Union that whoever came to India on or after March 24, 1971, should be declared foreigners irrespective of whether they are Hindus or Muslims.\", Gogoi said it was the Congress which had sought for preparation of the NRC to permanently solve the vexed foreigners problem of the state.\n",

The government, which should have been our guardian and protected our identity and future, has instead abandoned the people of the state. It is a shame and that is why we protest,” one of the agitators said in Jorhat. , In Lakhimpur, locals and the district unit of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) held a rally where hundreds of residents and artistes participated., Through music, poetry and slogans, the protesters warned the government not to impose CAA on the state. , They also demanded the immediate release of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) leader Akhil Gogoi who has been booked by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) amid the anti-CAA protests in the state. Akhil is one of the frontrunners of the anti-CAA movements in the state. , Earlier, Vir Lachit Sena leader Sringkhal Chaliha, too, was arrested on sedition charges for allegedly provoking the people against the State. However, later he was granted bail by Gauhati High Court. Chaliha said: “The government has tried to shut us up by putting us behind bars but we are the youths of the land of Lachit. We will not bow down in front of anyone.” , He added that Vir Lachit Sena does not have members but “soldiers who are ready to do anything for their motherland”. , Chaliha said: “Our only aim now is scrapping of the CAA.

So we thought of coming up with something for the December 22 Derby. Accordingly everything was done by the second week of last month. But that Derby got postponed. So we had to wait,” a member of the fan group told The Telegraph on Monday. , The first banner, or tifo, showed Bantul the Great, a popular superhero Bengali comic strip character created by Narayan Debnath, in East Bengal colours, being taunted by bete noirs Bacchu and Bicchu. “Ki re Bangal, NRC ashche! (You refugee, NRC is coming)!” it read. The next tifo showed Bantul as Bangal the Great punching the duo. , The last banner caught the imagination of the country. “Rokto diye kena maati, kagoj diye noy (Land bought with blood, not paper),” it read., Most East Bengal fans trace their roots to present-day Bangladesh, while arch-rivals Mohun Bagan boast a support base of “ghotis” (those of south-central Bengal origin)., The banner became a rage among opponents of the CAA and NRC, almost overshadowing Bagan’s 2-1 victory., The fan group said they had to face abuse from trolls on social media on Monday. “Irrespective of which club they support, a section of the fans is abusing us since morning. There are threats also. But the majority are with us,” the member added. , On Monday, the fan group posted a statement on their Twitter handle. “We have raised our voice against those who keep instigating us, hitting on our Bengal sentiment each and every time. We raised our voices against those who keep intimidating/threatening us by calling us Bangladeshi… Thanks to all the media houses for appreciating the idea… We would like to add that in no way is our protest related to any political party. Thank you all for the love and support,” they said. , According to one of the members, the group had a brainstorming session regarding the tifo in early December and shortlisted two to three ideas. “In Europe we have seen fans making tifos on superheroes like Batman and Superman. So we thought how about depicting Bantul the Great as a refugee. He is part of our growing up years. That’s how it began,” the member said. , “The entire process was very cumbersome. First we had to design it on photoshop, then some members, who are good with sketches, did their part and later the colouring part. We always prepare tifos in Sonarpur,” he added. , The total cost for the banners was around Rs 55,000 and most of the money was raised through an online donation campaign. “That’s a common practice among fan groups of most of the clubs. Online campaigns and sale of memorabilia are always helpful,” he said., Meanwhile Debabrata Sarkar, senior official of the club, said in a democratic country everyone has the freedom to express views.\n",

Later, KMSS’s women’s wing, Nari Mukti Sangram Samiti, laid siege to the jail here and residents of Tingkong blocked Rajgarh road, demanding his immediate release. The protesters also shouted slogans against the government. Traffic was disrupted for an hour after locals blocked the road., KMSS Dibrugarh district secretary Hemanta Konwar said, “Sensowa was arrested for his participation in the anti-CAA movement. The government is imposing the CAA without the consent of the people. His arrest is a ploy to dislodge the anti-CAA movement. We condemn such act. We demand his immediate release because he has done nothing. We will continue our protest till the CAA is repealed.”, Sources said Sensowa was spearheading the anti-CAA movement in the district., Konwar said members of self-help women’s groups in the area have decided not to repay loans taken from government-aided micro finance companies till KMSS leaders are released. He “condemned the arrest of KMSS leaders”., The first KMSS leader to be arrested in police crackdown on CAA protesters was Akhil Gogoi in Jorhat on December 12. He was arrested as a preventive measure amid protests against CAA. On December 13, Guwahati police registered a suo moto case against him. The case was handed over to National Investigation Agency (NIA) on December 14. The NIA booked him under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)., KMSS Barbaruah anchalik secretary Biju Tamuli was also arrested for “vandalism and violence” during CAA protests in Dibrugarh on January 2 night., Dibrugarh superintendent of police Sreejith Tiraviam said, “Sensowa was arrested in connection with violence, vandalism and arson. We have scientific evidence against him and arrested him on that basis. We have enough evidence against the persons who were involved in vandalism and violence.”, Dibrugarh, the home district of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, had witnessed massive protests against CAA. , Many government installations like the post office, United Bank of India branch, the circle office, the zilla parishad chairman’s office, Chabua town committee office and gaon panchayat offices in Chabua were damaged during the protests.

The Left government in Kerala has passed a resolution against the CAA., “I would request the governments of all the north-eastern states and the Opposition-ruled states to pass resolutions against the act. They should also study the rules of the NPR before taking any decision on the exercise,” Mamata said., This is the first time in recent times that Mamata has tried to reach out to elected governments in the Northeast, where the resistance to the CAA is linked to the perceived threat to the linguistic and cultural identities of the indigenous communities. , In contrast, the narrative against the CAA in other parts of the country is based on the central government’s decision to grant citizenship on religious lines., Sources in Trinamul said Mamata was well aware of the difference, but tried to send out a message to those agitating against the CAA in different parts of the Northeast that she was willing to join forces with them. , “Geographically, the Northeast is closer to north Bengal…. She timed her message accordingly so that it draws attention,” a source said., The source said the BJP-led governments in Assam and Tripura and the other governments in the region were unlikely to heed Mamata’s advice, but her message was more to the protesters so that pressure can be kept up on the Centre., In Siliguri, where she inaugurated Uttarbanga Utsav, Mamata referred to the January 17 meeting the Centre had held with the states to discuss the NPR. Bengal was the only state that stayed away., “I am ready to walk alone. The governments of the north-eastern states should understand that the Centre has improperly briefed them,” the chief minister said.\n",

Last month, she had gone on a hunger strike to demand the release of her son, who she believes has been “framed”., Participating in the rally, popular singer Manas Robin asked the people to keep patience as the anti-CAA movement will continue till it is repealed. “Today, Akhil Gogoi may be behind bars but he wants every Assamese to fight for the rights of the people of the state. So we have to continue this fight on his behalf,” he said., Meanwhile, BJP ministers and leaders continued to face black-flag protests. , In Goalpara district, Assam agricultural and animal husbandry minister and AGP president Atul Bora was shown black flags by AASU members at Bhalukdubi, the entrance to Goalpara town. Hundreds of protesters blocked the main road and raised slogans. , Faced with the protests, Bora’s convoy had to stop on the road for a moment. However, acting promptly, police personnel engaged on duty cleared the road immediately. Later, referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s three wise monkeys, Bora told reporters, “I don’t see evil, I don’t speak evil and I don’t hear evil”., In Tinsukia district, Lakhimpur MP Pradan Barua and Sadiya MLA Balin Chetia were shown black flags at Dhola, near Bhupen Hazarika Setu on National Highway 37, by AASU members and locals while coming from Sadiya to take part in a BJP workers’ meeting.

While 821 Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended by the BSF while illegally crossing over to Bangladesh from India in 2017, 2,971 Bangladeshi nationals were arrested while leaving India in 2018, it says., BSF sources claimed that the number of Bangladeshis leaving India shot up in the aftermath of the publication of first draft of NRC in Assam on December 31, 2017. , “Fear among illegal settlers seems to have triggered the migration after more than 40 lakh people were excluded from the NRC’s second draft in mid-2018,” a BSF source said., The director-general of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Major General Md Shafeenul Islam, had said earlier this month that 445 Bangladeshi nationals had left India in the last two months. , “About 1,000 people were arrested in 2019 for illegally crossing the border from India to Bangladesh, of whom 445 were returning home in November and December alone,” he said., The NCRB report says security forces arrested at least 2,070 Bangladeshis across the country in 2018 for committing crimes like murder, sexual abuse and forgery. In 2017, 2,725 Bangladeshis were arrested in India for committing similar crimes., The bureau started compiling data on people caught while crossing India’s international borders in 2017., The BSF guards the international border in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Mizoram. The Assam-Bangladesh border areas have been infamous for influx, cattle smuggling, fake currency and gun-running rackets., Groups protesting against CAA fear that the Act will open the road for lakhs of Bangladeshis to sneak into the state while the government has been defending the law saying that it will grant citizenship to only a “marginal” number of people who are already in India., The NRC was conducted in Assam to detect and deport illegal migrants who came to the state after the midnight of March 24, 1971. The cut-off date adheres to the 1985 Assam Accord. The CAA seeks to grant Indian citizenship to religiously persecuted minorities belonging to six non-Muslim communities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who came to India before 2015.\n",

He clarified how the NPR was different from data collection for the census. , “The main purpose of decennial census is to collect data for statistical purpose, and not for identifying individuals,” he pointed out., Under the NPR, he said, people would have to give their Aadhaar number and that would strengthen the State’s capability for surveillance., At the end of the session, those present took a resolution urging the government to repeal the CAA and to not implement the NRC and the NPR., They also resolved to urge the Jharkhand government to pass a resolution against the CAA and for non-implementation of the NPR and the NRC., They also urged people not to give any information during the NPR-NRC process to prove citizenship, and demanded that the central government immediately remove all restrictions on constitutional rights of people.\n",

It is being updated in Assam to solve the state's long-pending foreigners problem. The first draft NRC was published at midnight on December 31, 2017, while the second draft is slated to be published on July 30 this year., Kishore Bhattacharjee, a committee member, told reporters here on Friday that the way the process was being carried out, it was quite clear that it was a pre-planned step to deprive a large number of non-Assamese people, especially Bengalis, of their citizenship., \"A majority of the names of the people of this valley was missing in the first draft NRC. Only around 30-35 per cent names had appeared,\" he said, adding that this was an \"indication\" of the coming menace., \"We will keep fighting in a democratic way till citizenship of all the genuine people in the state is ensured,\" he said., Former Katigorah legislator and a committee member, Ataur Rahman Mazarbhuiya, said, \"We are not against NRC but harassment in its name should be stopped.\", He said people are being pushed to detention camps where they are treated in an \"inhuman\" manner.

Das, who has been suffering from dementia for long, was recently granted bail on humanitarian ground., Mazarbhuiya said he suspected there was a move to cause panic among the people using the NRC issue and create a divide between the people of the Barak and Brahmaputra valleys. He urged the government to take steps to ensure a peaceful atmosphere in the state., Another committee member, Sadhan Purkayastha, said they were not against any community or culture but against those trying to establish cultural aggression., He asked why the government was not taking any action against pro-talks Ulfa leader Jiten Dutta for openly threatening to take up arms if the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, was passed., On Dutta's recent announcement that he would come with a thousand cadres to Barak Valley to garner support against the bill, the committee said it was nothing but a \"publicity stunt\"., Members Sanat Koiri, Subrata Nath and N.

Nariman after perusing a confidential report filed by Hajela wherein he said the final draft of NRC could not be published on June 30, a deadline set by the apex court early this year, because of floods and that it would be published by July 30., The court accepted his contention but clarified that no extension beyond July 30 would be given for publication of the draft NRC., The court listed the matter for further hearing on July 31., The court also said the names of siblings and descendents of those declared \"foreigners\" by Foreigners Tribunals (FT) and those marked as \"D\" (doubtful) voters will not be included in the updated NRC. The eligibility status of \"D\" voters will be kept pending till FTs confirm their Indian citizenship., In his report, Hajela also sought additional security for himself and his family members, hinting at possible ramifications once the final draft NRC is published. The court accepted the plea and directed the chief secretary and director-general of police of Assam to assess the situation and provide requisite security to Hajela and his family members., The bench said the order was passed to \"ensure Hajela can perform the task entrusted to him with the utmost devotion, sincerity and free from mental worries and shackles.\", The court gave the Assam authorities seven days to file an action taken report on the enhanced security measures to Hajela., It is not immediately known what sort of threats Hajela and his family are facing but certain organisations have accused him of being biased in updating the NRC., The court also accepted Hajela's plea to delete 1.5 lakh names that figured in the first draft published on December 31, 2017 but were found ineligible during subsequent examination. The first draft contained 1.9 crore names out of 3.29 crore applicants., Hajela was also permitted to keep on hold names of \"descendants of declared foreigners and doubtful voters\"., The order was passed by the court in connection with writ petition (civil) number 274/2009 filed by NGO Assam Public Works (APW) in 2009, seeking deletion of names of around 41 lakh foreigners from the voters list of Assam., Welcoming the order, APW president Aabhijeet Sharma said if the name of a single foreigner is included in the updated NRC, they would again move the Centre, the state government and the Supreme Court., AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya also welcomed the court order., In another development related to NRC update, a team of senior government officers. led by chief secretary T.Y.

Dispur has been facing flak over the alleged irregularities and the difficulties faced by the people during filing of applications and in finding their legacy data., The allegations mostly revolve round middlemen charging money, especially in the rural and remote areas, to find their legacy data and to fill up and file NRC application forms and NRC seva kendras not functioning properly because of inadequate, and at times indifferent, staff., Pipersenia visited the office of the state coordinator of NRC here this morning and took stock of the NRC update status. State coordinator Prateek Hajela gave him a detailed presentation on it., The deputy commissioner of Kamrup (metro), M. Angamuthu, visited several NRC seva kendras here to take stock of their functioning., The NRC update basically means the process of enlisting the names of those persons (or their descendants) whose names appear in 1951 NRC, any of the electoral rolls up to 1971 and in their absence the admissible documents., In another development, state cabinet minister Rakibul Hussain today said the state government had written to the Centre to grant citizenship to Bengali Hindus and other communities who came to Assam following persecution \"since Partition\". \"The state cabinet recently took a decision to approach the Centre with a proposal to grant citizenship to people who came to Assam from another country out of fear or religious persecution,\" he said., A communiqué from the chief minister's office had yesterday said the government had written to the Union home ministry, requesting it to take steps so that people could use the voter lists from 1985 to 2014 as a document while applying for inclusion in the NRC., Though Dispur's move has drawn widespread criticism, the PCC defended it saying it would be in the interest of many indigenous people of the state to have their names included in the NRC. PCC vice-president Ripun Bora said many indigenous people, including those from the tea community, had not been able to find their legacy data or any other documents prior to 1971., NRC in Bodo: The RGI today approved issuance of the application forms for enlisting in the NRC in Bodo (an Eighth Schedule language) thus meeting the demand of agitating Bodo groups.

He said he would try and get the voter list included as an additional document., Political observers said it was another attempt by Gogoi to reassure (those neither possessing any of the 12 admissible documents nor figuring in the 1951 NRC or voter list till 1971) that he had not given up on his government's efforts to convince the Supreme Court to get the voter list included as an additional document. The court is monitoring the update., Gogoi had said yesterday that Dispur would soon file an \"interim application\" in the Supreme Court to consider all voter lists from 1985 to 2014 as additional documents for the ongoing update of 1951 NRC., Gogoi said: \"Since the Supreme Court has not accepted our affidavit on the issue, we will file an interim document before the court considering the urgency of the issue. By making such plea before the apex court, my government is not deviating from the modalities prepared to update the NRC.\", He went on to add: \"All voter lists from 1985 have been prepared on the basis of 1971 electoral rolls. This is not my observation. It is the job done by the Election Commission. So, what is wrong on the part of the government to request the Supreme Court to consider all voter lists from 1985 to 2014 as additional or supporting documents for the NRC update? It is only the Congress party which is advocating 1971 as the cut-off year for the NRC update and all other issues to solve the vexed illegal migrants problem in the state.\", So far only 18 per cent households in Assam filed applications for inclusion in the NRC.\n",

But we need to know everything happening along the border,\" said a source., Amid the anxieties over the NRC and its impact on the border districts of Bengal, Mamata has asked MLAs from Alipurduar and Cooch Behar to return to their constituencies and monitor the situation., \"I returned to Alipurduar on Tuesday on the instructions of the chief minister,\" said Sourav Chakraborty, the MLA of Alipurduar., The local economy has been affected. On Monday, people from neighbouring Simultapu and Srirampur in Assam did not come to a weekly market in Barovisa., \"The market here is largely dependent on these people. Later, we learnt that all people (in Assam) were busy checking their names at (NRC) booths,\" said Rajen Singha, a trader in Barovisa.\n",

            "Call for white paper on NRC - Telegraph India$ 04.06.17$Guwahati, June 3: Educationist Hiren Gohain today asked the Centre to issue a white paper on the progress of National Register of Citizen (NRC) update in the state as he fears the government is \"deliberately\" delaying it., The NRC, which is being updated based on the National Register of Citizens, 1951, and electoral rolls up to the midnight of March 24, 1971, had missed the deadline of publication on March 31 this year after which Dispur had set December 31 as deadline., \"But it is very unlikely that the update work will be completed before the deadline as we are seeing a lot of anomalies in the procedure. We have seen reports of NRC employees not getting their salary, seva kendras not working because of funds crunch and according to a recent report, about 3,000 NRC workers were laid off. At this rate, the work will not be completed in time,\" Gohain said., He further added, \"These reports raise serious doubts over the Centre's commitment towards update of the NRC. So, to know the truth, we have asked the Centre to issue a white paper giving details on how much funds have been released so far, and where those funds were spent; how many people are working under it and how many have been laid off,\" Gohain said at a news conference here this morning., The NRC guidelines of the update are provided by the Centre but its implementation is done by the state government under the guidance of the Registrar General of India, who functions as the Registrar General of Citizen Registration under Rule 15 of Citizenship Rules, 2003, as amended in 2009 and 2010., Gohain said the lethargy in the update process is a \"deliberate\" ploy of the Centre, which is pushing its \"Hindutva agenda\" by implementing the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016, that will give citizenship to minorities from neighbouring countries., \"The BJP-led government came to power promising to protect jaati (community), maati (land) and bheti (home) and Sonowal had given utmost priority to the update process. Despite that, after the passage of one year, such anomalies are cropping up. I think it is a delaying technique in order to publish the NRC after the bill is passed,\" Gohain said. He asked organisations like AASU, AJYCP and KMSS to maintain pressure on the government vis-à-vis the NRC.\n",

Funds of Rs 900 crore released by the Centre have been spent and another Rs 75 crore has been released by the Centre. Putting together a flawless NRC is our government's topmost priority and funds are not a constraint for the same,\" Patowary said while replying on behalf of the home and political department, portfolios held by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal., On Deka's call for the speedy completion of NRC work, Patowary said: \"We also want an updated NRC quickly but we can't allow a single foreigner's name to be included in the rush to complete the work.\", \"It is a lengthy process and verifying the documents and family trees of more than 5 crore applicants takes time.\", Patowary's statement was interpreted by many Opposition MLAs as a hint that the state government could miss the March deadline for a draft updated NRC., In November last year, the state coordinator of NRC, Prateek Hajela, had assured a delegation of the Conscious Citizens' Forum that a draft NRC would be ready by March., The NRC is being updated in Assam following a directive of the Supreme Court to solve the state's longstanding foreigner problem. The names of applicants who can prove that they or their forefathers' lived in the state on or before March 24, 1971, will be included in the updated NRC., Patowary, however, admitted that the process faced some problems because of non-payment of salaries to 7,500 data entry operators hired by Wipro, an IT company engaged by the NRC coordinator's office as a consultant. \"We have instructed Wipro to pay salaries to them or the state government will recruit them and pay the salaries so that NRC work is not hampered,\" he said., Earlier, IT minister Keshav Mahanta, when asked by Congress MLA from Golaghat and former PWD minister Ajanta Neog why the state government was going to re-verify a large amount of documents submitted for NRC update, skipped a direct reply., \"The state government wanted to have a draft NRC within March but the Supreme Court wants a flawless NRC,\" Mahanta said, hinting that the process could take some more time.\n",

This correspondent met many such people who voted only because of this fear., \"I have not cast my vote for the past 10 years as I had no interest in elections. But this time I did not skip it out of fear that my name may get deleted from the NRC,\" said Chakraborty, who works in a private firm., The NRC is being updated in Assam based on the National Register of Citizens, 1951, and electoral rolls up to the midnight of March 24, 1971. The sole purpose of this exercise is to detect illegal migrants living in Assam., Along with other necessary documents, people trying to include their names in the NRC also have to submit their family trees at the NRC seva kendras., \"Although it's not something to be proud of, I had also skipped voting. This time the NRC is being updated in Assam and I came to know from some people that the government may delete the names of people who do not cast their votes in the Assembly elections. I had to face a lot of trouble collecting the necessary documents for NRC update and so I do not want to take any risks,\" said Bhor, who cast his vote at 1035 Janata Lower Primary School in Dholai constituency., An election official, however, told The Telegraph that there was no link between the NRC update process and voting. \"It's our right and everyone should cast a vote in the elections. The process of updating NRC is going on in Assam and it does not have any link with casting votes in elections,\" the official said., But the rumours swirling around forced Pratima Rani Das, who had never voted in her life, to exercise her franchise on the insistence of her mother., \"I never used to vote because I knew that the situation would remain the same. My parents voted in every election but what did they get? Our road condition worsened, industries closed down and poverty rose. Can you give me the assurance that my vote will make a change?\" Das said.\n",

He alleged that a conspiracy was being hatched to ostracise Bengalis in Assam in the name of NRC. \"We will be in danger if we do not become aware. It is time to stand together to fight for our rights, dignity and existence.\", He said the family tree verification is part of the trick to exclude Bengalis from the NRC.

So we have not fixed any new deadline for publication of the final NRC. We will be in a position to do so only after the apex court's next hearing,\" Patowary said., The NRC is being updated on the basis of National Register of Citizens, 1951, and electoral rolls up to midnight of March 24, 1971., If an applicant's name is not there in either of these records, then he/she must submit documents that are a part of the list of admissible documents issued up to March 24, 1971. The sole purpose of this exercise is to detect illegal migrants living in Assam., The Supreme Court is supervising the process of NRC update and the Centre is funding the project., In a written reply to questions raised by Opposition AIUDF legislator Aminul Islam, Patowary said the NRC authorities had received 68.08 lakh applications for inclusion of names in the updated NRC and had so far completed 97.34 per cent spot verification. Of the 5.96 crore documents submitted by applicants as proof of their Indian citizenship, 4.53 crore have been verified., Patowary said unlike in other parts of the country, for residents of Assam the Aadhaar card project is linked to updated NRC. So, it would be taken up only after publication of the final NRC. He said chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal has asked the NRC authorities to be very careful while verifying the NRC documents so that not a single genuine Indian citizen is left out. Patowary said original inhabitants like the tea community would be eligible to get their names included in the NRC without submitting any document., Replying to questions on the welfare of small tea growers, Patowary said the state government would earmark Rs 54 crore in this year's budget (scheduled to be presented on Tuesday) to undertake welfare schemes for those engaged in small tea gardens., He accused the previous Congress government of doing little in recent years for the welfare of small tea growers, who have so far contributed Rs 163 crore to the state's coffers by paying tax on green leaf. The state government, under the Assam cess utilisation policy, collects cess on per kilogram of tea leaf., Minister of state for commerce Nirmala Sitharaman said in the Lok Sabha that to encourage small tea growers and give them better price for their products, the government has proposed to amend the Tea (Marketing) Control Order 2003 so as to define mini and micro factories and exempt them from obtaining no objection certificate for manufacturing tea, says PTI. To ensure better price to the small tea growers, price sharing formulas have been notified for different tea growing states, she added.\n",

            "NRC chill in leprosy colony - Telegraph India$ 05.08.15$Jorhat, Aug. 4: Over six decades ago, the Baptist Mission settled 40 socially ostracised lepers in what was then a no-man's land, bordering Nagaland. The site was at least 20km from civilisation. They tilled the barren land to eke out a living and drew comfort from one another., Though leprosy is no longer an incurable disease, struggle for survival for the descendants of these lepers still continues. Problems have compounded only recently after the process to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) began in the state., \"We have no documents to submit along with the NRC forms. My parents hailed from Lakhimpur but we have no money to go there and bring the required documents . We don't have money to click photographs either to submit along with the form,\" said Bhagyawati Bharali, an inhabitant of the colony. \"It will take at least two days to go to Lakhimpur to get the required documents and we cannot bear the cost,\" she added. Bhagyawati's husband, Gobinda, is a daily wage earner and barely manages to keep the home fires burning with his meagre income., The settlement is still known as Leprosy Basti or Bemari Basti, and many still maintain a distance even though the disease afflicts none of the second-generation inhabitants. The 15-odd families in the locality eke out a livelihood by working as daily wage earners and through small-scale farming. \"The nearest shop is 15km away. We live in a different world, away from civilisation,\" said Bhagyawati., Sushila Bora, an elderly woman, said many had left the village which had no electricity, drinking water or roads leading to the settlement, over the past few years. One has to walk across the Rangkham rivulet passing through the Gabharu parbat tea estate to reach the colony., The village today has only three persons suffering from leprosy, all of them aged above 75 years. Sushila's husband is one of them. \"We cannot afford to take him to hospital. No doctor visits the colony nowadays,\" she rued., Tapas Pal, another settler, said a few families of the colony had submitted their NRC forms but it was a Herculean task for them. \"I had to go to Tripura from where my father hailed to get a few documents to submit along with the NRC form,\" he said., In 1955, the Baptist Mission started treating people with leprosy at the Christian Medical College Hospital here. The disease, according to popular belief, was considered more of a divine retribution for sins committed in one's previous birth. The segregation and social ostracism that followed were more painful for the lepers than the physical manifestations of the disease., The Baptist Mission was their only resort. The organisation not only provided medical treatment for the lepers, but also began matchmaking to rehabilitate them. Twenty couples from across the region were settled on a 240-bigha plot at Rajabari along the Assam-Nagaland border then. There were families from Tripura, Assam (Goalpara, Silchar, Sarupathar) and even from Siliguri in Bengal in the colony., One of the surviving members of the first batch of settlers, Suren Kaul, said nothing had changed over the years. \"The only difference between then and now is that there are no elephant herds around anymore.\", Basanta Pal Tanti, the lone teacher of the Rajabari L.P. School, said the colony was still cut off from civilisation and the settlers were least bothered about taking part in the process of NRC updating. \"It is a question of survival here and in such a scenario, very few are serious about the NRC,\" he said. Tanti, who has been teaching at the school for last 22 years, said he had visited the school only when the Rankhang rivulet remained dry. \"There is no bridge over the rivulet and it is impossible to cross it to reach school during the monsoon,\" he said. Tulsi Gogoi, another inhabitant of the village said development was the need of the hour at the settlement and only then the NRC update process would hold any meaning for them., Till date, the lower primary school and a church were the only signs of progress in the colony.\n",

Gowala said the first problem was that the NRC  seva kendras were opened far away from the gardens which made it difficult for the workers to come out of the estates for the update process., Moreover, Gowala said the  seva kendras remained closed on government holidays and on Sundays when the workers are free., Another problem is to get photographs of the workers submitting the forms as there are no studios in the remote areas where the estates are located, he said., Gowala said though the government was requested to open temporary centres like help desks within the estates by taking help of the garden managements for the workers, no such initiative had been taken except in a handful of gardens., The association's president said the garden managements, too, had not extended any kind of help or aid to make the workers, most of whom were unlettered, to get involved in updating the process., \"Workers are part and parcel of the tea industry and they have contributed to its growth. So gardens are also duty-bound to guide and assist them as welfare of the workers is under the ambit of the labour law,\" Gowala said., He said without the co-operation of the managements it is not possible for the workers to find legacy data or records of their ancestors who worked in the estates., \"Even literate people are finding it hard to fill up the forms. So the workers, who are mostly unlettered, will need assistance.\", Gowala said with the deadline (now extended to August 31) approaching for submission of filled-up forms, the managements should come forward to facilitate the update process in whatever possible way they could so that workers do not remain left out., He also urged Dispur to keep the  seva kendras open on Sundays and other holidays for the workers., Gowala criticised the Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha, the largest and oldest union of tea workers in Assam, for not taking proactive steps in this regard., An official of a tea growers' association in Assam denied the ATTSA's allegations saying the gardens were providing whatever assistance needed.\n",

We even left cultivation for days as we needed time to collect certificates for my children from different offices. We want the new NRC as early as possible,\" Hakim told The Telegraph as a staff of the seva kendra handed him a receipt of his application., The new NRC, which is likely to be issued early next year, will not just provide relief to Hakim but also help his 14-member family shed the \"Bangladeshi\" tag. His neighbours and thousands of others suspected to be illegal migrants from the neighbouring country face the same dilemma., \"Wherever we go, we are suspected to be Bangladeshis. I was born in Assam. My father's name is there in the NRC 1951 and I have voted regularly. The updated NRC will silence all those who call us Bangladeshis,\" said Hakim, the smile still intact., \"You all submit papers as early as you can,\" he told several others who came from the neighbouring sars (riverine areas) and sat under a tree near the seva kendra. Many queued for link certificates from a panchayat official, which is required for inclusion of their children's name in the updated NRC., , Nayeralga, inhibited by over 6,000 Muslims, is one of the sars in Assam which are often suspected to be \"hub of Bangladeshis\"., The suspicion is more in case of those in Dhubri district as it shares 134km of India's 4,096-km border with Bangladesh - 44km (riverine border) still remaining unfenced. Assam shares 263km of the border while West Bengal (2,216km), Tripura (856km) Meghalaya (443km) and Mizoram (318km) share the rest., About 600 of nearly 3,500 families in four sars - Nayeralga parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 - have already submitted their applications since June 23 when the process began formally, said Bipul Sarma, a seva kendra staff posted there., The NRC of 1951 is being updated only in Assam following a Supreme Court order earlier this year. All those who submit documents to prove theirheir forefather's existence in Assam till March 24, 1971 will be included in the updated NRC., Sabur Ali, 52, who walked 3km from his village Sadhurchar with a copy of 1966 voter list looked tired but was excited about NRC. \"We have been casting our votes regularly but the voter list, which we showed as our proof of citizenship, is often doubted. Once we get the new NRC, we will be able to show it as proof of our Indian identity,\" he said., Ali claimed he was born at Mohorichar, another riverine village, about 20km from Nayeralga but had shifted to Sadhurchar about 40 years ago. \"Mohorichar is closer to the Brahmaputra, which gobbled our entire 26 bighas of land. So we shifted here and are working as daily wagers as we don't have land here to cultivate,\" said Ali. He claimed his father Moidan Ali is an original resident of the sar., For Ali, inclusion of their names in the new NRC means more than just ensuring their Indian identity. The process, he thinks, will bring development too as their areas remained neglected because of the long foreigner problem., \"Since the sars are suspected to be illegal Bangladeshi settlements, our problems have remained. Roads are bad and we have to carry patients on our shoulders to Bilasipara for treatment. The only health sub-centre in our village has only one doctor. Once the NRC removes the Bangladeshi label from us, we hope these problems will be addressed,\" Ali said., \"We have to cross the Gaurang river daily by boat for school. We face more problems during floods,\" said Hazrat Ali, a Class IX student of Nayeralga Higher Secondary School. Hazrat lives in Baghmara, about 2km from Nayeralga., There are four breaches along the 10km road that connects Nayeralga with Bilasipara, a sub-divisional town and people have to negotiate the bamboo bridges. The situation in the neighbouring sars - Mayarchar, Bolirchar, Bakpara, Bojeralga, Thakuralga, Kandapara and Ghonimari - are similar, if not worse. \"These sars face serious floods every year as the Brahmaputra is close by,\" said Sheikh Ahmed Ali, a madrassa teacher in the queue outside the Nayeralga seva kendra.\n",

The Sabha had said Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes, more other backward classes and the tea tribes' communities in Assam (as mentioned in a few government documents) should be enlisted in the NRC without having to produce any documents. The Sabha will also file a writ petition this week in the Supreme Court urging it to consider the demand., \"Asam Sahitya Sabha has its own line of thinking. They should also see the state government does not take advantage of the situation and include foreigners in the NRC. The BJP has one stand while the Congress has another. Amidst these, how can we expect a perfect NRC?\" said Bora when asked what he thought about the Sabha move., \"The Sabha had earlier stayed away from giving its opinion on the issue. It had been saying that it was the responsibility of the government. Had it raised the demand earlier, the situation would not have come to such a turn,\" said Bora, when told the Sabha was going to file a petition in the Supreme Court., The Sabha yesterday took the decision after a meeting with prominent citizens and its former presidents. The citizens raised the pointlessness of trying to establish one's citizenship by producing documents and facing subsequent verification though one had been recognised by the government as an Indian citizen., A few indigenous literary bodies, including the Bodo Sahitya Sabha are also in favour of direct entry of \"indigenous Assamese\", \"indigenous communities\" and tea garden communities into the NRC. However, they have some reservations regarding communities belonging to Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes and more other backward class., Assam Public Works, an organisation, which had moved the Supreme Court on the illegal migrant issue, has been demanding for long that communities found only in Assam and not in any other part of the country should be entered directly in the NRC. The apex court on December 17 had set the deadline to the state government to update the NRC based on the petition filed by the APW., The AGP said the state was facing chaos in the name of NRC update. \"Anarchy started in the name of NRC update when the BJP came forward in favour of giving citizenship to Hindus who entered Assam from Bangladesh and the Assam cabinet's subsequent decision to include names of all Bangladeshis who entered Assam even after March 24, 1971,\" said Bora., Bora charged the Congress of \"insulting\" former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for not going by the Assam Accord and speaking in favour of allowing the 2014 voter list as an additional document for the NRC update. The accord was signed when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister., \"The situation has come to such a turn that we are worried that the attempt for a permanent solution to the illegal migrants issue will create a perennial problem. Both the BJP and the Congress have come forward in support of Bangladeshis considering the 2016 Assembly election. But the stand of AGP is clear - anybody who entered Assam after March 24, 1971, must leave the state. The future of the people of Assam rests on the NRC,\" he said., The AGP will hold an extended general house meeting at Kaliabor in Nagaon district on July 26 and 27 where it will determine its strategy to fight the 2016 Assembly polls.\n",

            "Protests against CAA: SC asks petitioners to approach HC, declines to set up committee - Telegraph India$ 17.12.19$The Supreme Court Tuesday declined to set up a committee of a retired apex court judge to inquire into the incidents of violent protests in different parts of the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and said that such panels may be appointed by the high courts concerned., It directed all the petitioners to approach high courts in respective states, where the incidents of violence have occurred, for redressal of their grievances and the setting up of inquiry committees., A bench headed by Chief Justice S. A. Bobde noted in its order that each fact alleged by the petitioners is disputed, on behalf of the Centre, by solicitor-general Tushar Mehta., Two main concerns of the petitioners have been that the students were indiscriminately arrested and they are injured and not getting proper medical treatment, the bench noted., The solicitor-general stated however that only two students from Aligarh Muslim University have been hospitalised and they are being treated at the university hospital itself and were not injured by the police, which was contested by the petitioners., Taking note of the allegations and counter-allegations, the bench, also comprising Justices B. R. Gavai and Surya Kant, said: 'Regarding the nature of the dispute and the incidents that have occurred we find it appropriate to appoint single committee in each state to collect the material for fact finding and we therefore consider this appropriate to direct the petitioners to approach the high courts of jurisdiction of incidents said to have occurred., 'We are confident that the Chief Justices of various high courts will call upon for inquiry, if needed, while appointing a committee including a former judge of the apex court or high court after hearing the union of India and respective states', The bench clarified that it is needless to say that 'high court will be at liberty to pass appropriate order with regard to arrest and medical treatment if brought to its notice after verification'., The bench noted that serious grievance has been raised by the petitioners that vice chancellors of the universities concerned were being ignored by police while taking action against the students., The bench also took on record that this fact is also denied by solicitor-general., 'We are sure that high court will look into all the aspects of the matter after hearing both sides and appointing appropriate committee to determine the fact finding'., The solicitor-general made a categorical statement that no student had been arrested so far., However, he said he cannot make any statement about the future., While the arguments were being made, the bench said: 'We have disclosed our mind (that incidents of each states will go to the respective high court).', While refusing to appoint a committee of a retired judge of the apex court as was done in the Telengana encounter case, the bench said, 'No parallel can be drawn between them. In Telangana, one committee could have gone into the incident but in the incidents of violence by the protesting students at Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University or any other place, it is not possible as the issue of jurisdiction will arise.', 'We therefore decline your prayer,' the bench told a battery of senior advocates appearing on behalf of the protesting students., Senior advocate Indira Jaising protested saying 'you have a way of disarming us'., 'We respect all judges as much as retired judges, sitting judges and also high court judges. But we will have more confidence if retired Supreme Court judge is appointed to conduct inquiry to determine the facts,' Jaising said., The bench refused to consider the newspaper reports to entertain the petitions on the issue., 'We are not going to read newspapers. We are not going to rely on newspapers to arrive at judicial decisions,' the bench said., The bench also took umbrage when the petitioners' lawyers raised the pitch of arguments saying, 'we do not appreciate shouting in the court. This is not a shouting match. This is not a street or place where you have to shout. You are shouting because media is here'., 'We don't want this kind of atmosphere,' it said, adding, 'We have told you four times we have the confidence that our high courts will be able to look into the matters and give the correct facts'., Senior advocates Jaising and Colin Gonsalves on Monday had urged the apex court that it should take suo motu cognisance of the violence unleashed on students all over the country, especially in Aligarh Muslim University., Jaising had told the court she has received messages from the students that they are feeling helpless as no one is there to look after them., Gonsalves had said that he had visited the hospital and lockup on Sunday where students form Jamia Millia Islamia were kept by the police., Students of Jamia Millia Islamia and locals protested at Jamia Nagar in Delhi on Sunday against the amended Citizenship Act., Protesters torched four buses and two police vehicles as they clashed with police in New Friends Colony. Police baton charged the protesters and used tear gas shells to disperse the mob before entering the varsity campus, detaining several persons allegedly involved in the violence., Later on Monday, a plea was also filed by present and ex-students of Jamia Millia Islamia, led by Vani Xaxa and others, seeking appointment of an independent judicial inquiry into the entire episode of Sunday and for fixing the responsibilities for the lapses.\n",

The state government is helpless and hence they are trying to divert people’s attention from the movement by making such political statements,” he added., “We just want to ask thousands of students who had gathered in front of Dispur, are they from the Congress?

Is it democracy?” he asked., Bora said the government is accusing the Congress of being involved in the violence to make the anti-act movement a “failure”. “Right from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass and other BJP leaders are attacking us. We dare the Centre to initiate a judicial probe by an acting Supreme Court judge to justify their claims.”, Modi said in Dumka, Jharkhand, on Sunday: “The Congress and their allies are creating a ruckus. Those who are creating violence can be identified by their clothes. The Congress has raised the storm over the citizenship act. They are behind the unrest and arson too.”, Former ministers Rakibul Hussain and Pradyut Bordoloi, who were at the conference, sought judicial inquiry by a Gauhati High Court judge into the violence that resulted four deaths. The Assam PCC also demanded Rs 25 lakh financial assistance to be given to the next of kin of people who died and those injured in the protests., Assam Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia on Sunday approached governor Jagdish Mukhi, seeking an inquiry into the violence perpetrated by protesters and security personnel alike., “The Prime Minister can identify the Assamese people that are protesting across the globe wearing floral gamosa and mekhela sador, the symbols of Assamese people, irrespective of their religion, politics or ideology,” Bordoloi said., Bora said his party would file a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging the act., The Congress has been vehemently protesting against the citizenship bill since its introduction in Parliament in 2016.

The biggest sufferers would be the poor and the marginalized we know from experience,' tweeted Kishor, adding hashtag #NotGivingUP, which he has been using ever since his outpourings against the JD(U)'s stand of supporting the Citizenship (Amendment Bill) in Parliament came under attack from leaders of the party., The idea of nation wide NRC is equivalent to demonetisation of citizenship....invalid till you prove it otherwise. The biggest sufferers would be the poor and the marginalised...we know from the experience!!#NotGivingUp, Sources close to the chief minister said that after his party opposed citizenship bill when it was first tabled in Parliament in January 2019, Kumar changed his stance as the BJP — JD(U)'s alliance partner — put forward the argument that the legislation was aimed at granting citizenship to more people and not otherwise., However, the eruption of violence against the Citizenship Amendment Act in the adjoining West Bengal, besides the northeast — where the JD(U) has made inroads in a few states — is said to have left Kumar iffy., Sources claimed that he might stick to his original stand of opposing the NRC., Kishor had dropped ample hints to the effect when he said on Saturday that the amended Citizenship Act 'per se' was not problematic but with NRC it became a 'lethal combo' that would be 'discriminatory'., Kumar, who has over the years weaned over a section of Muslims of Bihar from Lalu Prasad's RJD, has been apparently uneasy over the belligerence of some BJP leaders over their assertion that the state's Seemanchal region, which shares borders with Nepal and Bangladesh, was teeming with 'illegal immigrants' who would be driven out once the NRC was in place., When Kishor was on Saturday asked by reporters about several legislators, especially those from the minority community, being jittery about the backlash that the party's support to the amended act could lead to, he had replied: 'The chief minister is going to have a word with them and address their concerns.', However, the latest salvo by Kishor, who first shot to fame after he handled Narendra Modi's successful poll campaign in 2014, is likely to rankle the BJP, which has been baffled by his defiant opposition to the stand taken by the JD(U) and Kumar's reluctance to crack the whip on the former poll strategist whom he had inducted into the party in September last year and elevated to a top post in a few weeks.\n",

            "Prashant Kishor at odds with former clients  - Telegraph India$ 14.12.19$A deep irony underlies poll consultant Prashant Kishor’s sharp criticism of the Citizenship Amendment Act. , Three of his prominent former clients — Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy —  have turned pushers and enablers of the contentious law., Kishor’s current aggressive stand against the amended law is in consonance with that of his current client, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee., It’s also in line with the stated position of Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, the latest client of Kishor.  Kishor is also set to use his professional skills to assist the DMK in Tamil Nadu, yet another party firmly opposed to the CAA.   , Kishor, however, had made a name for himself by working with a party that is the chief architect of the contentious law. Kishor and his I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee) catapulted to prominence in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls that pitchforked Modi to power at the Centre. Then, Kishor was Modi’s chief election strategist and pushed the BJP’s manifesto that promised to bring the deeply divisive citizenship bill.   , Now Kishor not only is opposing the law pushed by his first and foremost client but also seems to be giving a clarion call to powerful anti-BJP leaders to defy the central government. “The majority prevailed in Parliament. Now beyond judiciary, the task of saving the soul of India is on 16 Non-BJP CMs as it is the states who have to operationalise these acts. 3 CMs (Punjab/Kerala/WB) have said NO to #CAB and #NRC. Time for others to make their stand clear,” Kishor tweeted., Last Monday was the first time Kishor had come out against the citizenship bill. His target was the JDU and its chief Nitish Kumar.,  “Disappointed to see JDU supporting #CAB that discriminates right of citizenship on the basis of religion. It’s incongruous with the party’s constitution that carries the word secular thrice on the very first page and the leadership that is supposedly guided by Gandhian ideals,” Kishor tweeted on December 9.  , Kishor’s opposition caught attention because he did so while being a vice-president of the JDU., With his prominent former clients favouring the law, Kishor seems to be projecting himself as a conscientious citizen trying to take up cudgels against the law that is being perceived as deeply divisive.\n",

Sources said Kishor thrice offered to resign but Nitish rejected the proposal. , The statement Kishor made while coming out of Nitish’s residence suggested efforts are afoot to find a rapprochement.,  “My stance on the CAB (as the amended law was known when it was a bill)  is clear. I have said it publicly and it has been for everybody, not just Nitish Kumar. The party has done whatever it had to do, and now he (Nitish) will take further decisions on it,” Kishor said., The sources said the reconciliatory notes suggested Nitish may revise the party stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or refer it for reconsideration to a larger party forum.  , Kishor did not give any indication that he is altering his stand. The amended citizenship law, together with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), could turn into a lethal combo in the hands of the government to systematically discriminate on the basis of religion, Kishor said., He vowed to not give up on the issue and appealed to the 16 non-BJP chief ministers in the country that “the task of saving the soul of India was now in their hands as it were the states who have to operationalise these acts”., Punjab, Kerala and Bengal have already said that they would not implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the NRC, indicating that the issue could turn into a stand-off between the Centre and the states. Kishor said it was “time for others to make their stand clear”., Kishor became a member of the JDU in September 2018 and was elevated to the post of national vice-president a month later, becoming virtually the number two in the party’s hierarchy after Nitish., Asked about the acerbic statements against Kishor by the JDU  leader in the Rajya Sabha, R.C.P. Singh, the poll consultant said Singh was a senior leader and what he said should not be amplified.,  “Nitishji asked me to leave everything to him with regard to whatever has been said about me as it comes under the jurisdiction of the party president. I am also not bothered about whatever allegations are made against me,” Kishor said., The sources said Nitish reminded Kishor at the meeting that the latter had promised to strategise for the JDU for the Assembly elections due next year as well as the next Lok Sabha polls.\n",

If you attack the artery of the Constitution —secularism — every neighbourhood will speak out… the law may have already been passed, but the dawn is never late. In the history of India, before and after Independence, laws have been taken back,” Abdul Moeed, a protester near the NIMN stage, told The Telegraph., At the protest of youths from the Northeast, Arman Ali, a disability rights activist from Assam, weaved through the crowd on his wheelchair. “The process (of updating the National Register of Citizens) was peaceful until the CAA was passed. This draconian law will push Assam and the Northeast 30 years back…. We have no problem between Hindus and Muslims; the Assamese don’t hate Bengalis, our problem is illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.”, Ali admitted that the aim of the larger crowd was against the NRC — which he supports — and that despite the proximity of the protests, there had been no attempt to discuss the difference of views., This is a dilemma Xattriya artiste Srijani Bhaswa Mahanta also faces. “There is no space for individual nuances,” the JNU student from Assam said. “I oppose the CAA and we are going for a candlelight vigil at Assam Bhavan. But there are also problems with the NRC. It’s a huge scam with no account of actual expenditure that has led to many suicides and now the government says we will do it again. We can’t keep proving our citizenship.”, The student said there were videos of Bihari shopkeepers and migrant labourers being forced to chant “Joy Ai Axom (Hail Mother Assam)”, and being roughed up. “But the moment you say that there are some xenophobic tendencies in Assam too, you are ostracised. If we don’t recognize these problems, we have a stalemate and we can’t go forward….

            "Wound so deep people won’t forget: Chidambaram - Telegraph India$ 13.12.19$Veteran Congress leader P. Chidambaram, who has handled portfolios like finance and home at critical times, feels Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inflicted injury on India’s social and political fabric and promoted crony capitalism. In an interview with The Telegraph, the former minister said the combine of the amended citizenship law and the National Register of Citizens was as a clear message to Muslims that they would be treated as second-class citizens henceforth. Excerpts from the interview follow:, Q: The Congress said Narendra Modi was destroying India. People gave him a bigger mandate. Can’t the Congress read the pulse of the nation or is it incapable of confronting Modi’s demagoguery?, Chidambaram: I don’t think there is absolute truth in what you are saying. There are elements of truth in each one of the factors that you mentioned. My reading of Mr Modi’s election victories is, he is able to conjure up issues at the time of elections which have a very emotive appeal to that particular electorate, especially in north India., This approach will not succeed every time. In Maharashtra they expected 150 seats, they got 105. Let’s see what Jharkhand does. I believe that lack of Opposition unity has helped Mr Modi, along with his ability to convert an issue into an emotive nationalist issue. But as we go forward, you will find that this cocktail he has cooked up will not help.  , Q: How do you see the abnormal rise of money power in elections? , Chidambaram: The electoral bond is a way of legalising corporate corruption. The cap was removed, any amount of money can be donated. And the donor remains anonymous and only the government knows who is the donor and who is the donee. This is a readymade situation in which the corporate (houses) will donate only to the ruling party. We find that 95 per cent of the corporate (houses) gave money to the BJP. It was a very cleverly devised scheme, done without adequate consultations and by overruling the Election Commission and the Reserve Bank of India., Some day there will be an inquiry into how the scheme was hatched and implemented. , Q: You are well versed with international politics, corporate power and market logic…. Does Modi suit these forces better than the Congress?, Chidambaram: Absolutely. I don’t want to take names but it is an open secret that certain business houses have been extremely favoured under the Modi regime while others suffered. My assessment is today, there is less competition than there was six-seven years ago. Many industries have become oligopolistic. Corporate (entities) don’t like market competition, they like oligopolies and monopolies. Mr Modi’s approach favours that kind of preference., Q: Won’t the economic slowdown affect the corporate admiration for the Modi regime?, Chidambaram: The oligopolies and monopolies will continue to thrive. The slowdown will affect sectors where there is stiff competition. It has already affected the construction sector, infrastructure sector, transport, power, telecom, automobile… all these are tremendously affected.  , Q: Are you suggesting Modi is good for crony capitalism but not business per se?, Chidambaram: No, Mr Modi is pro-business, not pro-market. But the government does not treat all businesses equally. It is no different from the age when favoured businesses thrived under government patronage in the United States. , Q: What about global powers? They too have an obvious preference for Modi…., Chidambaram: They will prefer anyone who thinks like them. Today, who constitutes the best-known club in the world? I leave it to you to draw what is common among them. Mr Donald Trump, Mr Bolsonaro (the President of Brazil), Mr Netanyahu (the Israeli leader), Mr Erdogan (Turkey), Mr Putin, Mr Xi Jinping…. This is the club and every one of them is authoritarian, Rightwing and doesn’t really believe in a competitive market economy., Q: What’s the reason for the rise of such leaders across the world?, Chidambaram: One of the reasons is rising inequality. There is a ferment in societies about the growing inequality. Leaders who speak for the majoritarian section of the people indulge in populism and get support. But overall, it is bad for the economy, business, world trade and investments. , Q: What happens if the government manages to put economic growth on a high trajectory over the next few months and recreates the feel-good factor in the country? Will the political misadventures be forgotten?, Chidambaram: Eventually, economy will trump all other factors. But I don’t think people will forget the wounds inflicted on J&amp;K, on the Northeast, on the law and order situation in north India and on farmers. The injury is so deep and festering, people won’t forget it. , Q: Do you have any suspicion about the electronic voting machines?, Chidambaram: I don’t have any personal expertise to decide whether the EVMs are tampered with or not. But there are a large number of well-meaning people who say that EVMs can be tampered with and have been tampered with. Is it not better to put aside that debate? When an overwhelming majority of parties demands paper ballots, (and) the world has gone back to paper ballots, why not paper ballots here?, Q: Is the Election Commission’s response in tune with the democratic spirit?, Chidambaram: This is a captive Election Commission. The only voice of dissent has been stifled, threatening him with cases. Hopefully in future, we will have independent election commissioners. , Q: The government has been accused of a political witch-hunt. Almost every Opposition party has made that accusation. Some would say you too are a victim of political vendetta…., Chidambaram: I don’t comment on my case. I decline to answer this question., Q: What about other cases?, Chidambaram: Every defection in Karnataka, in other states, where the BJP lured MLAs and leaders from other parties is part of a witch-hunt. The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution (which deals with defections) has been reduced to nullity. There is fear everywhere; among politicians, businessmen, media. When the fear quotient reaches a certain level, it becomes easy for an authoritarian regime to exploit it., Q: There have been several unseemly incidents and cases. Did the government escape adequate legal, political and social scrutiny?, Chidambaram: There hasn’t been enough scrutiny. The kind of scrutiny that happened in Bofors wasn’t applied to the Rafale case. Mr Modi has been lucky. Why do we assume that these cases will never be scrutinised in future?, Q: The judiciary appeared to be tougher on the UPA. There were concerns about judicial activism from different quarters. Now, commentators and a section of intelligentsia talk of judicial abdication., Chidambaram: Mistakes were committed by the UPA and the Opposition actively exploited them. It is inevitable the Supreme Court will be invited to look into those mistakes. I would not say the Supreme Court has been partial or favourable towards any party. I think the Opposition couldn’t articulate its concerns forcefully, (it) failed to convert charges into legally determinable issues. , Q: Should social activists like Sudha Bharadwaj rot in jail for such a long time in a mature democracy?, Chidambaram: It’s condemnable. At the risk of commenting on a sub-judice case, I don’t think it is justified at all., Q: Many people, and a section of the Congress, feel the Modi phenomenon is an outcome of the Congress’s failures and misdeeds. Cases, right from Gujarat riots to fake encounters and Snoopgate, were not seriously pursued…., Chidambaram: The Gujarat riots were not investigated by the central government., Q: And so many corruption cases…. An impression had gained ground that the Congress must be kicked out and India needed a strong leader, a saviour., Chidambaram: I concede that the BJP succeeded in creating an impression that the UPA regime was corrupt. But there is more corruption today than there was allegedly –- allegedly -– under the UPA. There are many scandals waiting to be exposed. If the BPCL is privatised, that alone will be a scam running into thousands of crores. The Opposition will have to unite and pursue these matters., Q: Except the stale concept of Opposition unity, have you anything else to offer?, Chidambaram: Opposition unity is important. The opposition has to offer a common minimum programme. We did have the UPA. We can have another UPA. , Q: What if Modi and Amit Shah defeat the united Opposition again? What is India’s future then?, Chidambaram: I doubt that will happen. There is widespread unrest and a deep-rooted economic crisis. This is the most dysfunctional situation that I have seen India in the last few decades. People listened in Maharashtra and Haryana., Q: How will you counter the polarisation the NRC-CAB combine will cause?, Chidambaram: The CAB-NRC is an explosive combination, I call them Siamese twins. NRC will exclude and the CAB (as the Citizenship Amendment Act was known when it was a bill) will come to accommodate non-Muslims. The entire idea is to send an unambiguous message to Muslims that you are not wanted here. If you have to remain here, you are second-class citizens. Muslims are fearful but the bulk of the people protesting are Hindus. , Q: Finally, a question about your party. Did Rahul Gandhi commit a mistake by disinvesting in his own leadership?, Chidambaram: When a person says he is not inclined to continue, we should respect that and let him be.

            "NRC here to stay: Rajnath  - Telegraph India$ 12.12.19$Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday claimed that the BJP would form a majority government in Jharkhand., Singh, addressing a public meeting at K.B. High school ground in Dumri, said the BJP had people’s support as it fulfilled its promises, such as abrogating Article 370, making triple talaq punishable under law, and announcing a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya following the Supreme Court verdict. ,  On the Opposition’s criticism on the NRC, Singh said: “Is it not our responsibility to identify infiltrators in the country? We will neither accept them as Indian nationals nor grant them citizenship.” He asserted the NRC would be implemented across India., He said the Raghubar Das government in Jharkhand “changed the image and fate of the state in the last five years by providing a stable and corruption free government.”, “This election is not about an individual, not to make anybody MLA or minister, this election is to change the fate of Jharkhand. You have to elect the party which can fulfill goals,” Singh said. “While (BJP) Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee created Jharkhand, (BJP) Prime Minister Narendra Modi nourished it.” , Slamming the JMM, he said it neglected the plight of tribals. Urging people to vote BJP candidate from Dumri Pradeep Kumar Sahu into power,  he also spoke of the BJP’s achievements in giving people homes, gas connections and health schemes.\n",

            "Tryst with a new, chilling destiny - Telegraph India$ 12.12.19$New India has made a tryst with a new — but chilling — destiny. The passage of the citizenship (amendment) bill, which was passed by both Houses of Parliament, is a testimony to the growing distance between India and the Idea of India. At the hour of its inception, India, unlike its western neighbour, had chosen to follow the path of democratic constitutionalism. This implied that citizenship would be viewed as a matter of right, and that such a right would be bestowed on the principle of equality. India’s nationhood, a beacon to the world at large, had remained , composite in character. The Constitution had, thus far, ensured that the country refused to discriminate citizens on the basis of faith, creed, caste, language, gender and so on. The CAB, which had been accorded a pride of place in the electoral manifesto of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, has now struck a lethal blow to India’s pluralist ethic by choosing to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians — but not Muslims — from three neighbouring nation states. What is audacious about the CAB — the Union home minister is an enthusiastic proponent — is that it seeks to camouflage the BJP’s naked display of exclusion in the garb of humanitarianism. But the slip, unfortunately for Amit Shah and his party, is showing. Parts of the Northeast are up in flames. Assam, which has been sensitive to the issue of immigration because of its singular experience with influx, is vehemently protesting against the CAB as it threatens to upend the critical clauses in the Assam Accord. That the CAB has very little to do with benevolence is also demonstrated by the exemptions that the BJP was forced to extend to specific areas in the Northeast. When read in conjunction with the National Register of Citizens that Mr Shah has threatened to unleash on the republic, the CAB resembles an express political and ideological project, one which seeks to transform a secular republic into a majoritarian polity., The poison is not being administered by the BJP alone. It has received able assistance from several other parties whose vote in favour of the bill in the upper House has sullied their commitment to inclusion. The capitulation of the political fraternity implies that what stands between secular India and its implosion is the court. That outcome would be decisive for the future of this democracy.\n",

            "Persecution ‘hole’ in Citizenship (Amendment) Bill fuels theories - Telegraph India$ 11.12.19$The draft of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill that was circulated among MPs shows a “discrepancy” that had not been conclusively addressed even after the piece of legislation was passed in the Rajya Sabha., The statement of objects and reasons attached to the draft mentions “persecution” but the bill itself does not., It is not clear why the word has been omitted from the main body of the bill although an impression had been generated that the bill is aimed at helping those who had been persecuted in the Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan., The vacuum of explanation has been filled by speculation. One view is that it would be difficult for anyone to prove after all these years that he or she had been persecuted. The cut-off of December 2014 means at least five years have passed since the migrant reached India., Another theory is whether the omission was intended at accommodating non-Muslims who had been left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam., Of the 19 lakh left out, as many as 12 lakh are thought to be Hindus. But it is not clear whether the absence of the word “persecution” alone is enough to cover them under the Citizenship Bill., While applying for the NRC entry, all those omitted would naturally have claimed that they were already citizens of India. They might have been omitted because they were unable to back up the claim. , This raises the question whether they can — now that the Citizenship Bill has been passed — change their original claim and describe themselves as refugees or migrants from any of the three countries. If so, that will amount to the State condoning an incongruity., The statement of objects and reasons, which is usually examined by a court to understand the aim of a law if the matter is challenged legally, attached with the bill points out that “the constitutions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh provide for a specific state religion”., Then comes the P-word. “As a result, many persons belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities have faced persecution on grounds of religion in those countries. Some of them also have fears about such persecution in their day-to-day life where right to practise, profess and propagate their religion has been obstructed and restricted. Many such persons have fled to India to seek shelter and continued to stay in India even if their travel documents have expired or they have incomplete or no documents.”, The amendment text of the bill does not mention the word “persecution”. The amendment says: “Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before 31st day of December 2014 and who has been exempted by the central government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrants for the purpose of this Act.”, The “discrepancy” was pointed out by the Trinamul Congress in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday., Before the Rajya Sabha took up the bill for discussion, Trinamul MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the debate should be deferred because the bill had a “flaw”., “There is no reasonable nexus between the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ and the bill. Therefore, this bill is defective and the debate should be adjourned till such period the bill is rectified,” Roy said., Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu rejected the observation., “I have heard your argument and I have gone through the Rules of Procedures also.… I have gone through the bill and then I have given permission after getting myself fully satisfied that this bill is in order. There is no ground made out for seeking any adjournment of the debate on the bill,” Naidu said., Congress MP and veteran lawyer Kapil Sibal also referred to the “discrepancy”. , Sibal also pointed out some of the complications over proving persecution. “If a man came from Bangladesh or from Pakistan to India in 1972 and he has been an illegal migrant from 1972 till date, how will he prove, how will you say that he has been persecuted unless he says that he was persecuted? , “Amongst all the people who have come to India without any legal documentation, has anybody said that they have been persecuted? Do we have a law here which says that you apply and that you are persecuted and you shall be granted citizenship?” Sibal said., Neither home minister Amit Shah nor law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who spoke in Parliament on the bill as it cleared both Houses, referred to such possibilities.\n",

But when some contractual employees of the bank told them that only 50 such cases would be entertained, they started hurling stones at the bank,” said Ziaur Rahman, a local resident., Several people in Malda apprehend that if their particulars in the Aadhaar cards are not correct, they might not find their names in the NRC. They are queuing up at banks and post offices where such corrections are being made. They are even spending wintry nights outside such centres to get their Aadhaar details corrected at the earliest., M. Hansda, the bank manager, said: “Forms for correction were issued to 30 persons. But a large number of people were there and they all wanted the forms which led to violence.” , He refused to comment on the loss of bank properties., The scramble for the Aadhaar corrections triggered a demand for more centres to amend the particulars. However, Malda district administrative officials said any such decision had to be taken by the UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India)., “The district administration has no option of dealing with particulars of Aadhaar cards. It is entirely the job of the UIDAI,” said Rajarshi Mitra, district magistrate of Malda., Sanjay Das, the inspector–in–charge of Harishchandrapur police station, said: “Police intervened on time to prevent damage to properties inside the bank. An ATM was partially damaged.” \n",

By then, most of the NRC Seva Kendras had closed., AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said, “Around three lakh objections were filed on Monday evening. Approximating five persons per form, the total number of affected people will be around 15 lakh. The objections were filed by the people, helped by AASU and the other organisations.” , Official sources said the number of objections counted till Tuesday evening was 2.6 lakh. “Counting is on and it may go up by 10 per cent,” an official said., The complete draft NRC published on July 30, 2018, had the names of 2.89 crore out of 3.29 crore applicants. , Objection is a process where someone can protest against the inclusion of the name of a person who he thinks is not a citizen of India in the NRC. The highest number of objections, over 70,000, was filed in Barpeta district, where the pilot project for the update was launched in 2010 but was suspended in July that year following a violent protest against the modalities for the update., Barpeta additional deputy commissioner Pulak Patgiri said only 35 objections had been filed till December 30 but it swelled to over 70,000 before the deadline ended on December 31. There were over 19 lakh applicants in Barpeta district of which 2.7 lakh were excluded from the final draft list., Sources said the AASU and the 30 organisations had been preparing for long to file the objections. Their members and supporters from across the state had provided them information about doubtful citizens against whom objections could be filed., “Objections were filed against those who came to Assam in the recent past and set up villages and against those who seemed doubtful citizens. Inputs were taken from people living near them. The members of all these organisations had gone through the details before filing the objections,” a source said., The source said most of the objections were filed in lower Assam districts. , The members of the organisations had discussed the issue threadbare in several rounds of meeting. Then AASU appealed to the Supreme Court to allow people to file objections in the district headquarters, arguing that filing objections in the NSKs involved risk to those who wanted to file objections. The court had accepted AASU’s appeal., The number of claimants reached 31.2 lakh till end of the process on Monday from 30 lakh till Sunday, that is, over one lakh people filed claims on the final day, a day described as “hectic” by NSK staff., Additional reporting by Sunil Das in Barpeta\n",

Before this, Moinul Mulla and Sofiya Khatun, the 50-year-old woman were released on bail by a Supreme Court order. Khatun’s case made headlines as she was declared a foreigner by a foreigners court and then by Gauhati High Court on account of her failure to provide a legacy documents establishing a link to her father., Abedin, who has been included in the National Register of Citizens (NRC), said he was sent to the detention camp though he was not served with any notice declaring him a foreigner despite having all the required papers. He was called to the local police station in Barpeta Road district in 2017 on suspicion of being a foreigner. Abedin claimed that he had sent the relevant documents to Barpeta Road police station via a Muslim clergyman. But later he was asked to appear at the police station., Abedin, who is originally from Dhubri district, had migrated to Barpeta 20 years ago. The village in which he was born was swallowed by the Brahmaputra. His name was in the voter list of that district. But in Barpeta, his attempts to get his name enrolled in the voter list caught the eye of local authorities and raised suspicion., “Despite sending all the papers and documents that I had in my possession, I was called to the police station in Barpeta Road. From there I was sent to the office of superintendent of police (border) in Barpeta. It was here that my handprints were taken and I underwent a medical check-up. From there I was sent to the detention camp in Goalpara district. Neither was a notice sent not was I informed about anything. My name has been included in the NRC as are my children’s names. I was just trying to get my name enrolled in the voter list in Barpeta district and the authorities suspected that I was a foreigner,” said Abedin. \n",

BJP ka darwaza kisi ke liye band nahi. Jo bhi Bharat Mata Ki Jai kahega usko humarein party mein swaagat hai (Has anyone joined from Bangladesh? Whoever says Bharat Mata Ki Jai they are welcome in our party),” Shahnawaz said., Replying to another query on how many Bangladeshi citizens the party had deported in five years of being in power at the Centre though it often claims to do so and creates a sense of terror among a section of people in the country by harping on the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Shahnawaz said it would be done soon., “NRC will be implemented across the country at one go. Those who are staying in the country to save their freedom of religion will be given citizenship while others will be asked to go back to their motherland. It does not have to do anything with religion. No Indian should be afraid of it,” he said., Earlier, Hussain took a dig at the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance government in Maharashtra., “The BJP did not compromise with its principles. When it had alliance with Mehbooba Mufti in Kashmir the party made her chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai and killed terrorists like Burhan Wani,” Hussain said., Asked whether the party would enter into an alliance with its old ally Ajsu Party in case the BJP did not get majority on its own in Jharkhand, Hussain iterated the party slogan, Abki Baar 65 Paar., “The party is confident of winning 65 seats this time. If someone comes to become 66th, 67th and 68th, we will think over it,” Hussain said., Asked how he was so confident of winning 65 seats, he said: “Hamare paas Modi hai (We have Modi).” He added: “Modi hamari mazbooti hai aur Rahul unki kamzori hai (Modi is our strength, Rahul is their weakness)., Asked about the GDP growth slowing down and increasing prices of staples such as onions, Hussain said: “In the first quarter GDP remained low but it was better than any of the nations of the G-20 and the slowdown was very low in comparison to the economic slowdown across the world. “Do not worry.

Under this initiative, local youths are being taught about the Constitution and the citizenship rights it guarantees, and spreads awareness about it among the people living in remote and vulnerable places., Sambidhan Sevak volunteers have embarked on a door-to-door loudspeaker campaign to alert people on filing of claims. Two teams are moving in autorickshaws fitted with loudspeakers and stopping at village chowks and marketplaces, urging people to come out and file their claims before the December 31 deadline. They have also set up help desks near the NRC seva kendras (NSK) where volunteers are helping the unlettered fill up their claims forms. On Thursday, the volunteers visited Pahari, Chenibari, Padmapara, Chata, Khongra, Parghat, Pahari Parghat, Shila, Kakphuwa, Rowmari, Ganakpara and other places in Barpeta district. Some of these places are near sars and riverine areas, from where inhabitants come for daily trade and other work., The team said they found out that there are nearly 1,500 people in the places they visited who have not filed their claims owing to a lack of understanding of the process, failure to provide legacy linkage, technical error and other reasons. The team said besides informing about the deadline, they are also trying to bridge the gap in filing of claims by providing the best possible help., “The state government should have initiated such measures so that the poor and the illiterate don’t fail to file their claims. We are conducting this campaign as our responsibility to the civil society. The NRC is a state exercise and it is quite important to determine citizenship as genuine citizens shouldn’t get left out. We have embarked on this tour to alert the people to come out and file their claims as soon as possible. We are aiming to cover thousands in the next few days,” said team member Ashraful Hussain., “Some of the areas where we visited serve as a transit point for people travelling to and from sars.

The entire process takes time. The work has not slowed down because of a lack of funds. In a meeting held in New Delhi yesterday, the Union home ministry agreed to sanction the funds sought by us.

We have already spent Rs 335 crore but till then, we have the funds to carry on the work,\" the coordinator of NRC directorate, Prateek Hajela, said here today., The NRC 1951 is being updated only in Assam and all applicants proving their presence in the state till March 24, 1971 will be included in the updated NRC. The exercise had begun in February last year., There are four stages in NRC update - field verification, office verification, tracing family tree and matching the applications with those submitted by applicants already declared foreigners by foreigners tribunals., The clarification follows a claim by former chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently that the NRC update process had been slowed down by the BJP-led government in the state., Hajela, however, said he was not yet in a position to give a timeframe when the draft NRC would be published., \"We will try to make an assessment after the progress report is submitted to the Supreme Court. We will also request the Supreme Court to issue orders to other states so that verification of the documents sent to them is sped up. We had forwarded five lakh documents to 26 states for verification but we have received only 7,000 verified documents,\" he said., Applicants having their origin in other states and who had shifted to Assam, had submitted supporting documents for inclusion in the NRC and those had been forwarded to the respective states for verification., The office had also forwarded 402 documents to foreign countries for verification., Over 50,000 state government employees and 8,500 contractual staff are engaged in the exercise, which Hajela claimed was the largest exercise not only in the country but anywhere in the world., The state government had initially told the Centre that the NRC update exercise would require Rs 489 crore. \"Initially, the exact amount could not be estimated and it went up as the work is so massive,\" he said., Meanwhile, two persons were arrested at Dhekiajuli in Sonitpur district today, following the recovery of documents related to the NRC update process from a tea stall yesterday., The owner said he had bought the papers from a scrap seller., The arrested were identified as Raikashmari gram panchayat secretary Chandralal Upadhyaya and one of the tea stall owners, Subak Dutta., Sonitpur deputy commissioner Manoj Kumar Deka told The Telegraph today that the documents found in the tea stall were copies of marriage certificates, one of the documents required for NRC applications., Hajela, however, said those documents were not from the NRC office., \"We have both hard copies and digitised copies of all the documents submitted by the applicants but the documents recovered (Dhekiajuli) may be those issued by other offices before submission of the applications,\" he said., Additional reporting by Pranab Kumar Das in Tezpur\n",

Bhupen Hazarika, during his primetime of his career&lt;&gt;, spent his days at his Tollygunge residence in Calcutta and produced some of his immortal creations both in Assamese and Bengali. Even Sahityarathi Lakshminath Bezbaroa, strengthening the intrinsic relations, married Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's granddaughter Pragya Sundari. Therefore, being a chief minister of such a state which has its deep-rooted culture and traditions, Banerjee should not have made such baseless comments which have got communal undertones aimed at disturbing the strong relations between Assam and Bengal,\" it said., The statement comes a day after two FIRs were lodged against Sonowal in Calcutta by a TMC delegation that was sent back from Silchar in Barak Valley after they were taken into \"preventive detention\" and prohibited from exiting Silchar airport on Thursday citing possible disruption of law and order. Mamata decided to send the delegation after the final draft NRC released here on Monday showed names of 40.07 lakh applicants missing. Her charge left many here angered who alleged that the Bengal chief minister tried to disturb the peace and harmony between Assamese and Bengalis in the state., The statement said since the beginning of updating the NRC, some vested interests were \"hell-bent\" on destabilising the process by making remarks inimical to the age-old unity prevailing among the people of Barak and Brahmaputra valleys, hills and plains., \"Assam is a land known for its unity since ages. People belonging to different castes, communities, creed and religion symbolise unity, which is unique. Though several attempts were made to disturb this unity, people of Assam showed resilience and reinforced the state's unity\", Sonowal said., He further said the NRC was prepared under direct supervision of the Supreme Court of India with active role of the Registrar-General of India and is a document to safeguard the interests of the people of Assam. \"It is a matter of pride and prestige for the people of the state to be a part of the updating of the NRC and witness the complete draft publication in an atmosphere of complete peace and rejoice.

The Supreme Court upheld the order on March 8, asking Prateek Hajela, state coordinator for the NRC update, to keep aside the 48 lakh panchayat documents submitted by the people., The Joint Action Committee of Tea Tribes Adivasis, Assam, today urged the high court to reconsider the ruling as the people had came from other states about 200 years ago and for many generations they remained unlettered., \"Our forefathers came to Assam from Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha in 1851. The British had brought them to work in tea gardens as labourers. At that time, they numbered about 21 lakh and now the population is one crore.

So during the NRC update process, the tea tribes should get special dispensation since they do not have many legacy documents,\" said Satyendra Sahu, the general secretary of the committee., The committee said the tea tribes were not aware about collecting birth certificates or residential documents. As they live mostly in gardens, all their documents were registered with the garden managements. Moreover, it was not possible to go to the place of origin to collect any legacy data. The tea workers do not possess any land documents either., At the time of submission of documents for the NRC update, tea tribes provided residency certificates issued by the garden authorities, birth certificates from hospitals and residency certificates issued by local panchayats. The people are now apprehensive that if the court rejected panchayat documents, certificates from garden authorities might be also rejected, the committee said., Sahu said the committee will move the NRC officials, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Prime Minister Narendra Modi within a month and submit a memorandum to Hajela tomorrow., It will also hold meetings in every tea garden.

Das and DGP Kuladhar Saikia in the run-up to the final draft, the sources said., The deputy commissioners and superintendents of police were tasked with ensuring sensitisation at their level to counter false propaganda and instilling confidence in the process, and warning/cracking down on vested interests., Sources pointed out that no untoward incident related to the draft NRC was reported from anywhere in the state but the \"noise level\" on social media was also muted., \"This was possible because of proper implementation of the security plan which was bolstered by the sanctioning of 220 additional battalions by the Centre. The NRC office also carried out exhaustive print and audiovisual campaigns. Both chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Union home minister Rajnath Singh participated in the social media campaign to instil confidence and dispel fears before and after the draft. A lot of behind-the-scene work has gone into maintaining order,\" the source said.\n",

A joint task force of 20 members will operate checkposts on the Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways,\" he said. \"We will carry out screening and verification for 15 days. We believe the Manipur government will play an active role in this regard,\" he said., \"We have information that many might try to enter Manipur saying they are residents of Assam. We need to check the growing demographic imbalance and remain alert to prevent the entry of illegal migrants.

The officials there also told her that there was no circular or guidelines from Guwahati on how to deal with such cases., \"When I had filled up the NRC format, the papers were not accepted by the officials. They were not informed or trained on how to deal with the issue surrounding orphaned children. Today I was told to come on August 7. I also went to meet the deputy commissioner but the DC was not available,\" the matriarch of Mission Concern, which was recognised as a child care institute (CCI) by the government in April this year, said. It was recognised as a specialised adoption agency (SAA) under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, last year., At present, there are 21 children, aged seven to above 18, under Ambika's care. They hail from communities like Karbi, Dimasa, Kuki, Nepali, Bengali, Adivasi and others. A few of them are victims of ethnic clashes while the rest were either abandoned or given to her by parents who were too poor to take care of them., Of the seven orphans whose names have not featured in the draft NRC, three have been selected for adoption and will get the identity of their new parents. The remaining four are still waiting to be adopted., Banajit Sarma, protection officer (institutional care) district child protection unit in Karbi Anglong, who worked upon such cases at the Missionaries of Charity here when the NRC update began in 2015, said a detailed case history needs to be prepared for a destitute or an orphan such as how the child came to such a position and what situation led to it., \"Someone told Ambika to prepare a case history but she didn't know how to prepare one or whom to approach. She was busy taking care of the children as her husband was away. When the time came to fill up the NRC format, she submitted the form with photographs of her foster children attached to it. She was told by officials that they had no idea how to deal with such cases. Since Dhansiri is remote, maybe it was perceived that such circular need not be sent. For orphans, the name of the superintendent who takes care of them comes as the head of family. Legacy data is irrelevant because it won't matter,\" Sarma said., He had written a letter on behalf of Missionaries of Charity to NRC state coordinator Prateek Hajela in 2015 on how to deal with cases of orphans and destitutes under the NRC. After receiving the letter, NRC officials had visited the Missionaries of Charity for verification., There are four CCIs in Karbi Anglong, one government run and three private.\n",

But the process is not over yet and we need to ensure genuine Indian citizens are not left out of the register. People want the correct NRC,\" Mahanta said, recalling the roles of the AASU and the AGP, both of which he led, in the update of the register to weed out foreigners illegally staying in Assam., The conference was also attended by Biraj Sarma, another signatory to the Assam Accord. Both Mahanta and Das are leaders of the Mancha., The 1951 NRC update is being updated only in Assam under the supervision of the Supreme Court., Governor Jagdish Mukhi had also said on Monday that a pan-India NRC was a must as it would allow every state to know who its citizens are and who are not and also to check influx. He said having an updated NRC in one state was not sufficient because those declared foreigners in Assam would shift to another state to escape detection. \"Every state should keep an NRC and update it every 10 years. It will be a real achievement for the country...to know the number of its citizens and non-citizens,\" Mukhi had said, in his reaction to the NRC update under way in Assam., Mahanta also said he was opposed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, as it is against the Assam Accord. The Accord sets March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date for detection and deportation of foreigners while the bill seeks to provide Indian citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who fled religious persecution and entered India till December 31, 2014., \"We are opposed to the bill.

Thabah said nearly 1,500 persons were detected from the three check points. He said the state police did try to intervene after seeing the check points put up by the union., \"The checking continued till 4pm at Ratacherra.

She also said Bengal was ready to provide shelter to those left out of the NRC., The complete draft of the NRC - the second and final one was released on Monday - showed 40.07 lakh of the total 3,29,91,384 applicants missing.

Party spokesperson Rupam Goswami said, \"Mamata Banerjee's criticism of the NRC update is an attack on the Supreme Court because the drive was carried out under the supervision of the apex court.

But the foreigner problem remained unsettled,\" he added., \"But now we have to wait for publication of the final NRC to know who is an Indian and who is not.

The office has also sent over seven lakh text messages with the status of people's names in the part draft., \"The number of people visiting the seva kendras is very few while the number of people visiting our websites is huge - altogether 2.14 crore,\" Hajela said. The NRC office opened four websites to help people check their names. In view of the huge number of visitors, it opened eight more on Monday., With 1.9 crore names, the partial draft NRC was published at midnight on Sunday. Altogether 3.29 crore people from 68.27 lakh families had applied to update their names in the NRC with over 6.5 crore documents., Hajela said they had decided to take complaints from people only after the final draft was published. \"But spelling corrections are something we can do right away. People can approach the seva kendras and do it. We will come out with the protocol,\" he said., Many people had complained about their names being spelt wrongly in the draft. Hajela thanked the people for cooperating in the process., The NRC office is yet to come out with the districtwise break-up of the number of people in the draft NRC. According to district administration, the percentage is 87 per cent in Jorhat district and as low as 33 per cent in Hojai district., Former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, who had led the Assam Movement, met the Prime Minister on Tuesday demanding an error-free NRC.

In most of the minority-dominated areas, the seva kendras were the first destination of every citizen to check if their names appeared in the part draft of the NRC, published at midnight on Sunday., Communities such as Dimasa, Mising, Karbi and Deuri have nothing to worry about even if their names do not figure in the NRC because they \"are the original inhabitants of Assam\", said Dipulal Thousen, a Dimasa resident of Haflong. \"Where will we be deported? We belong to Assam since time immemorial,\" he added. Dima Hasao has a population of 2.14 lakh (according to the 2011 census) and in an area of 4,888 square km, a vast majority belong to the indigenous communities., Among the few people who went to the seva kendras, some found names of their family members missing while others found that one member was included and the rest left out., In Dhemaji, Majuli, Karbi Anglong and Lakhimpur districts, the scene was no different. Although it was a working day, there was a massive rush at picnic spots with a majority of population in the districts concerned preferring a day's outing instead of heading to seva kendras which they felt was \"not a matter to worry about\". Sections of Nagaon district, dominated by the indigenous community, also witnessed a thin turnout at the seva kendras. \"At least 20 per cent of the 182 seva kendras in Nagaon district recorded no visitors on Monday,\" an NRC official told The Telegraph., On the contrary, the seva kendras in religious and linguistic minorities-dominated areas of Nagaon and adjoining Hojai districts witnessed serpentine queues of people browsing through the lists since 8am when the centres were opened. Names of only 44.16 per cent population in Nagaon and 33 per cent in Hojai district were published in the part draft of the NRC., Disappointment was plainly written on the faces of a large portion of visitors to most of the 162 seva kendras in Hojai district at not having found their names in the list., Samsul Ahmed, a linguistic minority community teacher, told The Telegraph, \"We have been residents of Hojai town for ages. We applied for enrolment in the NRC, submitting proper documents and the names of all of my family members are there in the list. When documents are authentic, there is hardly anything to be worried. If it did not appear in the list today, it will come in the next list.\", Additional reporting by Vinod Kr Singh in Dhemaji\n",

We thought the party would bring many economic reforms if they came to power. Our friends had then told us that we would later realise the consequence of voting for a right wing party like the BJP,” said Adhiraj, a former South Pointer who jointly manages the family business with his father. , “Today, we regret voting for the BJP. They have made the economy worse and are adopting such divisive policies,” his father who wrote the Madhyamik from the school in 1982 said. , The protest rally held under the banner “concerned South Point alumni and friends” was to start from Deshapriya Park. , Another rally, by Artistes Unite, an association of actors and actresses, musicians, filmmakers and theatre activists, was supposed to start around the same place., The two rallies were planned separately but eventually merged and walked together as both were walking against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register., “When we found that the artistes were organising the rally for the same cause, both groups decided we should walk together and raise our voices,” Tamali Chaudhuri, one of the organisers of the South Point rally, said. Tamali, who took the Madhamik exams in 1985, said the proposal to organise a protest was floated on a Facebook page of former students of the school. “Initially, we were not sure about organising the rally, but the response was so good that we decided to do a march,” Tamali who was at the rally with her mother Sripurna Chaudhuri, who taught in South Point, said., The march by close to 500 people started from Deshapriya Park and went through Rashbehari AvenueSP Mukherjee Road crossing, Mudiali and ended at Menoka cinema. The national anthem and We Shall Overcome were sung before the start of the rally., Slogans like Hum Kya Chahte? Aazaadi rang in the air. Posters and banners quoting lines of defiance were carried. One such banner read: Kagoj ami dekhabo na/Adhikar aami chharbo na (I will not show my papers/ I will not give up my rights). Another read: Dhormer beshe moho jare eshe dhore/andho se jon mare ar sudhu mawre (He who is blinded by religion/Kills and ends up being killed)., Among those who walked was writer Antara Dev Sen, daughter of Amartya Sen and Nabaneeta Dev Sen, and an alumna of South Point. Music composer Debojyoti Mishra and actress Saayoni Ghosh and Anirban Bhattacharya took part in the march., Many had the Tricolour., Saayoni said she had wanted to walk in a rally against the CAA-NRC-NPR but acting assignments had kept her busy. “When I got to know of the rally by Artistes Unite, I immediately blocked the date because I wanted to be in the rally,” she said.\n",

Going to school has never been so special before. Our school is decorated with cut-outs of most popular animation characters such as Chhota Bheem. The gate and the classrooms are decorated with mango leaves, balloons, rangoli and banana trunks which create a festive ambience. We like to come to school regularly,” a kindergarten student of Learner’s Educational Institution said on Saturday. , Aarin Saha of MDM Public School was happy too. “We are getting chocolates, toffees, sweets and flowers. We are happy to come to school,” chirped Aarin. , Yashvi Kanu, 6, a student of Holy Faith International Public School, said, “The teachers and the principal are very friendly. I love my new school.”, Sanjay K. Gupta, managing director of Learners Educational Institution, told this correspondent, “We studied the problems of children and started using innovative techniques. We are happy to see them glowing with joy. These initiatives will make their school days memorable, definitely boost attendance and a child’s confidence, and minimise absenteeism and school phobia, if any.”, Thomas Ellis Gibson, a veteran educationist, said, “Though Assam is experiencing a normal winter, 11 degrees Celsius is recorded during the day and eight degrees Celsius at night. The mercury may dip further. A cold spell swept the entire Northeast last week. So, several guardians are thinking of sending their wards to schools only on or after Basant Panchmi (Saraswati Puja). , “The second and the most important reason for their absence is the ongoing movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Parents are taking their children to protest rallies. I have never seen such things in the past 30 years. Bringing children back to schools regularly is definitely a good initiative,” he added. , On Saturday, the weather was chilly and the anti-CAA protest was again intensified in Tinsukia district.\n",

            "Punjab Assembly calls for repeal of CAA - Telegraph India$ 17.01.20$Punjab on Friday became the first Congress-ruled state to pass a resolution asking the Centre to repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that has triggered the nationwide protests on for a month now., The resolution passed in the Punjab Assembly said: “The CAA seeks to negate the very secular fabric on which the Constitution of India is based. It is divisive and stands for everything opposed to a free and fair democracy which must enshrine equality for all.”, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh tweeted: “I have sworn on the Constitution &amp; I will continue to fulfil my duty as a loyal soldier. Sri Guru Nanak Devji had said ‘Na koi Hindu, Na Mussalman’ &amp; it is in this spirit Punjab Vidhan Sabha passed the resolution to appeal to the Central Government to repeal CAA for India’s interest.”, While the Aam Aadmi Party supported the resolution, the Akali Dal opposed it despite its assertion that Muslims should not be excluded from the ambit of the law., The Kerala Assembly was the first to pass such a resolution. , All Congress-ruled states have unambiguously rejected the CAA-NPR and the chief ministers even led public rallies against the CAA. While the Congress has formally asked the Centre to withdraw the CAA and stop the NPR, senior leader Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the amended law., The Punjab chief minister said in the Assembly that the entire country was witnessing resentment against the CAA and there was turmoil even in the educational institutions. Singh said his government, too, will move the Supreme Court to challenge the CAA, like Kerala has done., The resolution said: “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, enacted by Parliament has caused countrywide anguish and social unrest with widespread protests all over the country. The state of Punjab also witnessed protests against this legislation, which were peaceful and involved all segments of our society. The CAA is aimed at distinguishing illegal migrants on the basis of religion, which is not permissible under the Constitution. It is also violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Right to Equality and equal protection of the laws to all persons.”, The resolution added: “The ideology behind the CAA is thus inherently discriminatory and is as far away as it can be from being a humanitarian measure. In the backdrop of these facts, it is evident that the CAA violates the secular identity of India, which is the basic feature of our Constitution; therefore, the House resolves to urge upon the Government of India to repeal the CAA to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality before law for all religious groups in India.”, On the NPR, the resolution said: “Given the apprehensions about National Register of Citizens (NRC) and that the National Population Register (NPR) is a prelude to the NRC designed to deprive a section of persons from citizenship of India and implement CAA, this House further resolves that central government should amend the forms-documentation associated with the NPR to allay such apprehension in the minds of the people and only thereafter undertake work of enumeration under NPR.”, Singh later told reporters: “The issue of the CAA has shaken the entire country. The youth have understood that what the central government is doing is unconstitutional. What is happening in this country? We need to learn from history. In the 1930s, the same happened in Europe. First, they were against communists, then they were against Jews., This is religious cleansing. Akalis have forgotten the teachings of even Guru Nanak while supporting the CAA. , I will gift Hitler’s memoir Mein Kampf to all the Akalis so that they would know how fascist ideology is being implemented.”\n",

            "All fall but one stands tall: Jadavpur University campus - Telegraph India$ 17.01.20$The BJP government has reduced institutions like Parliament, the judiciary and the media to “rubber stamp” but has failed to contain universities, which have “held out” despite repeated attempts to bend them, economist Prabhat Patnaik said at Jadavpur University on Friday., “One of the first things that the BJP government tried to do on coming to power was to capture the universities. They put handpicked people of the RSS as vice-chancellors in a whole range of universities. JNU, Santiniketan…. The idea was they would infiltrate the teachers’ association, the students’ union and thereby break the unity of the students. But they have not succeeded…. So, Parliament, judiciary, media, all these institutions have been reduced to a role of simply rubber-stamping the BJP government’s decisions. One institution that has actually held out is the universities,” Patnaik said in his address to students., “It is not surprising that the resistance to fascism at this moment in the country is being led by students.”, Patnaik is professor emeritus at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s school of social sciences. He was at JU to speak at a convention to mark the fourth death anniversary of Rohith Vemula, the Dalit student of the Central University of Hyderabad who was allegedly driven to suicide., Student leaders from Aligarh Muslim University and the Central University of Hyderabad, teachers from universities such as Presidency and students from several institutions attended the programme., Patnaik explained why the students were spearheading the protest., “Very obvious…. Fascism implies unreason. Unreason suggests a belief and a way of establishing the truth value of a propagation. Unreason actually makes RSS propaganda into truth…. Against this unreason, the intelligentsia and the most active element of the intelligentsia is the students,” Patnaik said., The veteran professor drew a parallel between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Hitler but sought to make a distinction between the two regimes., “The one big difference between the fascism then and fascism now is that fascism then, even though it was ruthless and inhuman, temporarily succeeded in overcoming unemployment. As a matter of fact, between 1933 and the war, there was this short period during which Hitler was quite popular because the horrors of the war did not visit the German people and, on the other hand, the horrors of unemployment had been overcome by Hitler. He could bring the economy out of the crisis. Our current fascists in India are actually incapable of achieving that,” said Patnaik., Istiaq Ahmed, a law student at Aligarh Muslim University who was on the campus when police had allegedly barged in and beat up students on the evening of December 15, said if the students did not speak up now, the future generation would not forgive them., “If we don’t protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens now, the posterity won’t forgive us. They would say: the freedom fighters had brought us Independence, but what were you doing when the BJP government was taking the Independence away,” said Istiaq., Abhisekh Nanda of the Central University of Hyderabad said the Modi government had launched an attack on the very Preamble to the Constitution and a fierce resistance that was being led from campuses was the only hope., The point about the Modi government failing to capture universities was raised by former JNU student Umar Khalid during a public meeting at JU against the CAA and the NRC on Monday., Patnaik said the success of the movement by the students lay in the fact that they had forced the judiciary and political parties on issues such as the right to dissent and the CAA and the NRC., “The judiciary over the past two days has made a slight turn. This is an outcome of the students’ movement. That is also happening to political parties. Just look at Navin Patnaik. His party had voted for the CAA in the Rajya Sabha. But now he is speaking against implementing the act…. As the movement is escalating, it is casting its impact on judiciary…. This will revive the parties and give them backbone,” said Patnaik., Unity among political parties could provide the only way forward, he added. “The students have struck the widest possible unity among themselves, leading to the spread of the movement across campuses. But now the political parties have to do this. They have to come on board.”\n",

Kyrsoibor Pyrtuh, who have been a part of the anti-CAA movement, told reporters here on Thursday that their petition challenges the constitutionality of the Act, its arbitrariness and attack on the freedom of religion and privacy of individuals., The petition was filed on Monday., The petitioners said the Act fails to take into account the “realities” of those inhabitants of the border areas who came to India from neighbouring countries till December 31, 2014 but follow indigenous religions and do not identify as being a part of any of the six selected religious communities under CAA — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian. , They alleged that the Act was a design to create a divide among tribal communities, especially those who follow the traditional indigenous belief systems like the Niam Tynrai and Songsarek and have followers among the Khasi-Pnars and Garos who do not fall under any of the religions mentioned in CAA. , Niam Tynrai are those among the Khasi-Pnar people who profess the indigenous faith while Songsareks are those among the Garo community who follow the indigenous faith. These are distinct belief systems and not a part of any mainstream religion, They alleged that the Act is arbitrary and motivated by religious discrimination and by the Hindutva ideology, which is based on the belief of Hindu majoritarianism and supremacy in India, and treats minorities, religious or otherwise, as secondary., They pointed out that the original Citizenship Act, 1955 was enacted on the same principles as the Constitution, and no religion-based conditions were imposed for the acquisition of citizenship. , They alleged that the Act does not follow the constitutional principles of secularism and equality and violates the right to privacy of refugees belonging to indigenous tribes following traditional religions and imposes unconstitutional conditions upon them. , The petitioners apprehended that the Act would also impact various persecuted tribal communities in Bangladesh and Myanmar, including members of the Chakma, Hajong, Rabha, Khasi and Garo communities., They pleaded that the court should issue guidelines for a “just, fair, and equitable” immigration regime until such time that Parliament sees fit to enact a constitutionally valid law. , The petitioners termed the exemptions accorded to some northeastern states as “pointless, useless and diversionary”. “We believe that the struggle to protect our rights as tribals in India cannot be divorced from the struggles against a system which tries to create a monolithic India based of religious majoritarianism,” they added.\n",

Stressing the urgency of a stay, it cites how, three days after the notification, the Uttar Pradesh government had forwarded to Delhi a list of 40,000 illegal Hindu immigrants to be granted citizenship., The first application cites what it says are contradictory statements made by ministers about the probability of a countrywide NRC, and about the link between the NRC and the NPR., It says home minister Amit Shah has declared several times --- for instance, at Bongaon in Bengal on May 1 last year --- that the NRC would be implemented across India., However, the Prime Minister on December 22 said at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan that his government had never discussed a nationwide NRC, the application adds., Also, the application says, then junior home minister Kiren Rijiju had told the Rajya Sabha as far back as November 2014 that the NPR was the first step towards the creation of a nationwide NRC., It quotes Rijiju as saying: “The National Population Register is a register of all the usual residents which include(s) citizens and non-citizens…. The NPR is the first step towards (the) creation of (a) National Register of Indian Citizens by verifying the citizenship status of every usual resident….”, However, it says, two days after Modi’s Ramlila Maidan statement, Shah stated: “There is no link between the National Register of Citizens and the (upcoming) National Population Register.”, The application cites a remark from heavy industries minister Prakash Javadekar de-linking the NPR from the NRC but adds that on December 29, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad made a contrary statement in an interview., It quotes Prasad as saying that a “proper legal process” will be followed for a nationwide NRC, including consultations with state governments, and that “some” NPR data “may or may not be used” for the NRC., “Such contradictory statements given by the ministers… are creating widespread confusion and panic…. Therefore the (government) must clarify their stand,” the application says.\n",

            "Validity of a law is important: Chidambaram  - Telegraph India$ 16.01.20$Former Union minister and top advocate P. Chidambaram believes that states’ refusal to accept the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and start the process of National Population Register (NPR) is not a simple case of “rejection of a central law” and the standoff should be seen in the larger context of constitutionality and the prevailing ground reality., The governments in Bengal and Kerala have formally communicated to the Centre that the NPR exercise should be halted, while almost all Opposition-ruled states have refused to accept the CAA. The Congress Working Committee has also passed a resolution asking the Centre to withdraw the CAA and stop the NPR. , The Centre has dismissed this opposition, asserting that the states are under constitutional obligation to implement laws passed by the Centre., Asked if the states have the authority to reject a central law, Chidambaram, who has handled the home ministry in the past, told The Telegraph in an interview: “I don’t think it is a case of ‘rejection’ of a central law. The validity of the central law  is an issue.  A state government could justifiably say ‘let’s wait for the issue of validity to be settled by the Supreme Court’.  That would be a legitimate and prudent course to adopt.”, Chidambaram added: “On the NPR, the census commissioner intends to start the exercise on April 1, 2020. A state government would be entitled to take into account the situation in the state, the law and order situation, the availability and willingness of personnel, the financial burden on the state, the measures to overcome resistance from the people, the steps to be taken in the case of ‘unresponsive’ households etc. Each of these is an important issue that has to be resolved before a state government can be compelled to obey the directions of the census commissioner. Let’s see how the census commissioner takes things forward.”, Many people have taken a public vow that they won’t show the papers to the enumerators. This is bound to create a tricky situation and it will be incumbent on the state governments to deal with it. Also, if more than 12-13 big states collectively refuse to cooperate with the Centre, there is bound to be a constitutional crisis. That can also trigger an unprecedented political conflict.  , The government of Kerala has also moved the Supreme Court, describing the CAA as unconstitutional. Many other petitions are also there under consideration of the apex court. The other states are in a dilemma despite their stiff opposition to the CAA-NPR as a court ruling in favour of the Centre can significantly weaken the states’ position. No Congress government has so far moved the court.  , Asked what would happened if the Supreme Court ruled there is no constitutional problem with the CAA, Chidambaram said: “How can we anticipate what will be the judgement of the Supreme Court? Eminent lawyers and jurists (including former judges) have opined that the CAA is discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as well the basic structure of the Constitution. The grounds raised in the petitions are sound and logical.”, To a question whether the states will have to implement the law if the court declared it perfectly valid, Chidambaram said: “Again, you are presuming that the Supreme Court will uphold the constitutionality of CAA.”, Many Congress leaders fear the political battle on CAA-NPR allows the Narendra Modi government to divert the nation’s attention from the alarming economic crisis. , Asked about the perception that politics on CAA-NRC is going to polarise the society and yield political dividends to the BJP, Chidambaram said: “The CAA is part of the Hindutva agenda of the RSS-BJP. If the CAA had gone through without opposition or protest, it would have indeed polarised society.”, He added: “Fortunately, the CAA has run into stiff opposition, not only from political parties but also from large sections of the people cutting across religion, caste, language and region. I am proud of our youths and students who have risen in revolt against an obnoxious and divisive law. This kind of pan-Indian opposition to CAA gives me hope that we will not allow this issue to polarise the electorate. On the contrary, we could use the anti-CAA (anti-NPR, anti-NRC) protest movement to mobilise people belonging to different religions, languages and castes to vote against the BJP in an election.”\n",

Tyagi asserted that the NRC draft had been prepared on the directions of the government and that it was not the final list. \"We want an all-party meeting with stakeholders to remove misgivings about the issue,\" Tyagi told The Telegraph., BJP leaders of the state have so far remained silent on the issue even as new party entrant from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Naresh Agarwal, has demanded that the NRC be compiled in Bihar and Bengal too., The JDU was categorical on the other contentious issue that could lead to a face-off with the BJP: the citizenship amendment bill aimed at rehabilitating non-Muslim refugees in Assam and other Northeast states. The move has been met with strong resistance in Assam, including from BJP ally Asom Gana Parishad., \"A delegation from Assam had met Nitish ji on the issue. The people of Assam and northeast states are against it. We stand by the people and we will oppose it,\" Tyagi said., Ironically, socialist leaders had in the eighties supported the AGP agitation on the issue of \"threat to Assamese culture due to infiltration\"., \"We supported the issue because it was related to the local Assamese population against outsiders. But this central government is trying to communalise the issue. Chief minister Nitish Kumar should clear the stand; does he support the NRC?\" said RJD's Shivanand Tiwari., Bihar leaders want the issue to be dealt with carefully as a large number of Biharis live in Assam for generations.\n",

One NSK will cover at least 10 villages., \"We are taking technical support not only for co-ordination among our staff engaged in the exercise but also in verification of documents and providing information to the people, who will be able to apply for NRC update online, apart from the physical process but he/she will have to be present during verification by our staff. The applicants will be informed through text messages, email or public announcements. We have developed a software that will detect if any fake document has been submitted by an applicant to enlist herself/ himself in the updated NRC or any fraud practice adopted by applicants. The applicants can submit documents of their parents for enlisting,\" commissioner and secretary of home and political department, Prateek Hajela, said here today., A public awareness campaign about the exercise will begin from the latter part of this month followed by house-to-house distribution of application forms next month. The legacy data - a database of the electoral rolls between 1951 and March 24, 1971 - will be published in the last week of this month and made available to people, including on the website  www.nrcassam.nic.in. \"We will begin the process in 100 NSK in Kamrup, Kamrup (metro), Nagaon and Nalbari and will extend to others soon,\" Hajela said. He said the final and updated NRC rolls are likely to be ready by January next year., Update of the NRC 1951 has been a longstanding demand from different quarters, including the All Assam Students' Union which led the six-year-long Assam Agitation (1979-85) against illegal migration from Bangladesh. The Centre, Assam and AASU reached an agreement in 2005 on making midnight of March 24, 1971, the new cut-off date for detection of the foreigners and enlisting citizens on the updated NRC., A pilot project in 2009 in Chhaygaon (Kamrup district) and Barpeta had to be stopped following a violent protests at Howly in Barpeta district by members of the All Minority Students' Union. The state government submitted revised modalities after discussion with different organisations, including the AAMSU and AASU. The modalities were approved last year and the Centre sanctioned Rs 140 crore for the exercise. The state had submitted a proposal of Rs 498 core., The \"doubtful voters\", at present barred from election, will be able to submit application forms for enlisting in the updated NRC but their verification will be done only after disposal of their cases pending with the tribunals., \"Those originally hailing from other states, however, will not be able to apply for the same.

The work started only after the BJP-led government came to power in 2014,\" Sonowal told reporters at the Assam Administrative Staff College here at Khanapara, after inaugurating a two-week joint induction training course for officers of Assam Civil Service (ACS) and allied services., \"During the tenure of the Congress-led UPA government, very little funds were released for the NRC update, adversely affecting the process. It was the Narendra Modi government that released adequate funds for NRC update as a result of which the process started moving at a fast pace,\" he said., Yesterday, Gogoi had said work on the NRC update had slowed down under the new government and several deadlines had been missed. \"What is happening now? My government was very active, but still faced criticism even from the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the process,\" the former chief minister had said., Gogoi said he would seek a white paper from the government on the NRC status., The 1951 NRC is being updated in Assam with the objective of, among others, detecting illegal migrants living in the state., Refuting Gogoi's allegations, Sonowal today said the NRC update had gained momentum in the last four months after his government came to power in the state., \"My government has taken every step in the past four months by taking the people of the state into confidence. We are committed to ensure the security of the indigenous people of the state,\" he said., Earlier, addressing the newly recruited officers of ACS and allied services, Sonowal reiterated his government's commitment to providing good governance and urged the 2016 batch officers to be committed to their service to win back people's confidence in the administrative system., He advised the new officers to work diligently to strengthen the administration., \"Resolving the problems requires the highest degree of intellectual acumen and the new officers must develop an attitude of constant learning to improve their skills and mental ability,\" he said., He said the government was committed to making Assam one of the most developed states in the country and the new officers must work towards fulfilling this goal., \"It is very important that the officers remain honest in their actions, courteous in behaviour and compassionate to the needs of the poorest of the poor,\" Sonowal said., He said good work lived beyond life and the officers must work hard to establish their identity in the society., He congratulated the officers on their success in the combined competitive examination and said they must prove their brilliance in work and set an example for others., He also urged the officers to be innovative, sincere and hardworking to fulfil the aspirations of the people., The chief minister said his government was following Modi's mantra of \" sabka saath, sabka vikas (together with all, development for all)\" and was committed to providing security and livelihood to the poorest of the poor., He asked the officers to discourage corrupt practices to create a people-friendly environment., Sonowal also stressed the need to uphold the dignity of labour and advised the probationers to regularly interact with grade IV staff to understand their problems and build a healthy working relationship., The chief minister's media adviser, Hrishikesh Goswami, chief secretary Vinod Kumar Pipersenia, special director-general of police Kula Saikia, additional chief secretary S.L.

But, the police, after a preliminary investigation, found that the photograph of Munni in the electoral roll and the one that was submitted by Choudhury in the NRC form did not match., Police launched an investigation after a Karimganj resident Abdul Basit filed a complaint, alleging that Choudhury did not have a daughter and had produced false documents in the NRC form. He alleged that it was an attempt by Choudhury to provide citizenship to an alleged foreigner by using the name of another person., Choudhury, however, denied all the allegations, saying that Basit had made false complaints against him., Choudhury alleged that he was having a conflict with Basit over a plot of land and this was his way of taking revenge., He said Munni's original name was Parvin Khan and she was his sister-in-law Ratna Begum's daughter., \"When Munni was three, her parents handed over her custody to us.

It was set up later. We have reservations about 40 lakh people not finding their names in the register. This is a humanitarian issue. The people who have been left out must be given another opportunity and all these things should be done as per the law. Otherwise a serious situation will emerge.\", Taking part in the debate, Shah thanked Naveen's party and expressed \"grave sorrow\" that none else than the BJP and the BJD had found it fit to say that illegal immigrants had no place in this country., Shah's \"compliment\" was enough to embarrass Naveen's party and the Congress lost no time in saying that the BJD's secular facade had been exposed., The BJP had managed to convey the impression that the BJD had sided with the NDA on the NRC issue.

The purpose is to politicise the issue and drag us into an unnecessary controversy. The way Shah and the BJP's Odisha unit thanked the BJD shows that it was a calculated move to embarrass us.\", Speaking to The Telegraph, Acharya said: \"NRC was prepared according to the direction and supervision of the Supreme Court.

The main purpose of the updated NRC is to detect migrants who had illegally sneaked into Assam after March 24, 1971., \"We have moved the Supreme Court because the apex court had taken an impartial view on the NRC update. The BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the state, who are entrusted with the task of updating the NRC, are biased towards giving citizenship to Hindu illegal migrants from Bangladesh, which will violate the Assam Accord,\" Bezbaruah said., The Assam Accord had pegged March 24, 1971 as the cut-off for detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants from Assam., He accused chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal of supporting the move by \"remaining silent\" on this crucial issue., \"The Centre as well as the state government have taken this decision under the influence of the RSS since granting citizenship to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh is one of its main agenda,\" he said., Bezbaruah was also critical of the role of AGP president and agriculture minister Atul Bora on this issue., \"Bora, despite being a part of the state government, has totally failed to put any pressure on it to revoke the controversial decision of the cabinet sub-committee.

I hope the government has done it with good intention,\" Ajom told The Telegraph as he hesitantly stopped his bicycle on his way home from the nearby NRC seva kendra., The first draft of the updated NRC has his name and that of his son Arshad and daughter Sajina. \"They (the NRC centre staff) told me that names of my wife and daughter-in-law Ahiran will be published later,\" he said., Ajom owns only three katha of land and cultivates other villagers' land for a livelihood. \"Will the government now give us some land to cultivate? We have been hearing that landless people who are on the NRC will get land,\" he said., Akbar Ali of neighbouring Chauguri village looked a little disappointed: \"I had submitted the 1951 documents but don't understand why my family members' names are not there.\" He finally smiled after a bystander told him not to worry and wait for the next list. Akbar doesn't expect any personal benefit and instead hopes the government constructs a bridge over the Aie river to connect his village with the PWD road at Sonamoyee village. \"Now we have to pay Rs 5 to cross the wooden bridge. We depend on boats only during monsoon,\" he said., The updated NRC, for many in the minority-dominated Dhubri, is not just a proof of citizenship and identity alone. It brings in hope of having a house, erosion control measures and land for the landless. \"The river is continuously eroding our land. We are mistaken for Bangladeshis since we live in the sar(riverine) village and erosion here is not given importance. But now we hope the government will do something once we get the NRC. We also hope people in the sar are given land document,\" Ali Akbar said.\n",

Building ke sare mard hazrat ek saath building na chhoden, kuchh log female safety ke liye ruken.”, The general public — irrespective of religions — have taken point four seriously, with a large number of steel gates being erected in the lanes of North East Delhi after the riots that killed 53 people., A police crime branch statement to the media on the chargesheet said: “Twelve persons were arrested in the case. Investigation has revealed that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy to cause riots in North East Delhi. The list of arrested accused persons includes the names of Ms. Natasha Narwal and Ms. Devangana Kalita. , “Both Natasha and Devangana belong to the ‘Pinjra Tod Group’ and were actively involved in hatching the conspiracy to cause riots near Jaffrabad Metro Station, Delhi. They were also part of a larger conspiracy and were found to be connected to the ‘India Against Hate’ group and (activist and former JNU student leader) Umar Khalid. , “The following message, found in the phone of an accused, on WhatsApp chat, reveals the conspiracy and the extent of preparation for causing riots in Delhi.”, Pinjra Tod’s lawyers are yet to receive a copy of the chargesheet. One of them told this newspaper that they would respond only when the case comes to trial., Jawaharlal Nehru University students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal were arrested on May 23. Both have been booked in three FIRs each related to protests against the new citizenship matrix. , In one of the FIRs, Narwal is charged for alleged acts of terrorism under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. , Three students of Jamia Millia Islamia, including one who is pregnant, have also been charged under the stringent UAPA. , Former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi has slammed the Centre for arresting Kalita — an Assamese — for protesting against the CAA. The related National Register of Citizens had triggered massive protests in Assam. , Civil society groups in Delhi, and the Opposition, have spoken out against the arrests. The CPM, especially in Haryana, has been vocal against the arrests. Narwal is from Hisar in the state., A magistrate had earlier granted bail to Kalita and Narwal in connection with the FIR against the women’s sit-in at Jaffrabad, saying: “The accused were merely protesting against the NRC and the CAA and the accused did not indulge in any violence.” , On Tuesday, metropolitan magistrate Abhinav Pandey granted bail to Kalita in another FIR against a protest at Daryaganj, saying the police had furnished no evidence of “violent activity” by her. However, she is yet to get bail for the case in which the chargesheet was filed on Tuesday., The police have also filed a chargehseet for the rioting on February 24 against municipal councillor Tahir Hussain, who has been suspended from the Aam Aadmi Party.\n",

According to the official announcement, application forms for NRC will have to be submitted to the authorities concerned within July. So, there are reasons to believe the government is trying to create confusion through the NRC officials among people by giving different deadlines to submit the NRC forms. Such a development could be a part of Dispur's conspiracy to derail the entire NRC update process,\" Bhattacharjya said., The AASU leaders appealed to the office of the state coordinator of NRC to clear the confusion prevailing among the people about filling up application forms. Bhattacharjya said the process of filling up application forms must be easy, simple and hassle-free., Bhattacharjya said AASU would engage its lawyer to inform the Supreme Court about the Tarun Gogoi government's latest proposal to include those whose names figure in the latest electoral rolls in the NRC that is being updated in the state., Dispur had said on Tuesday it would write to the Centre about including in the updated NRC the names of all those who are registered in the latest (2014) voter list., AASU president Dipanka Kumar Nath said since the Supreme Court was monitoring the NRC update based on a set of modalities, the AASU smelt a rat in the state government's new proposal., \"In the greater interest of the indigenous people of Assam, the AASU feels it is very important to apprise the apex court about Dispur's move,\" Nath said., Bhattacharjya said the NRC is being updated according to the provisions of the Citizenship Act, under which eligibility to the update NRC would be ascertained on the basis of NRC 1951, electoral rolls up to 1971 and, in their absence, a set of specified alternative documents. \"Against this backdrop, the state government cannot propose the inclusion of all the people whose names figure in the latest electoral rolls in the NRC,\" he said., In a related development Assam Sanmilito Mahasangra, a confederation of indigenous people of Assam, and All Assam Ahom Sabha, questioned about necessity of updating the NRC. \"What is the reason for updating the NRC in Assam while it is not being done in other states of the country?\" they said in a statement., Assam BJP president Siddhartha Bhattacharya said they were concerned over the state government doing politics over the NRC update., He said that nobody should do petty politics on the NRC issue in the greater interest of the state.\n",

While one of the top priorities of my government is to see the completion of the NRC update to permanently solve the issue, I have categorically told the officials concerned to take each and every citizen into confidence while updating such an important document. The NRC update process must not create any sense of fear and insecurity among any section,\" Sonowal said in the Assembly this evening., Blaming the previous Congress-led government for unabated infiltration from Bangladesh, the BJP had assured people before the Assembly polls that it would end the problem and detect and deport illegal migrants as well as seal the Indo-Bangladesh border. Sonowal said his government would act in a time-bound manner to seal the entire stretch of the international border in Assam., The chief minister, while replying to the motion of thanks for governor P.B Acharya's address to the first session of the 14th Assembly, said the people have bestowed a great responsibility on his government. He said they were eagerly waiting for his government to bring about much desired change in the state., \"In this journey we have go ahead by taking people from different caste, community and religion into confidence. Assam is a land of Xankardeb, Madhabdeb and Ajan Fakir. This land cannot shine if one community or caste or religion remains secluded. In this august House also, both the ruling and Opposition parties will have to behave and act responsibly because the people have a huge expectation from all 126 MLAs sitting in this House. Development of Assam should remain above all politics. Being a chief minister, I will give equal importance to suggestions and plans of both ruling and Opposition whenever there is an issue of development,\" Sonowal said., Asserting that his government would implement the BJP's \"Vision Document\" in the state, Sonowal said transparency and accountability would be the sole mantra of his government. \"The people have told me that the menace of pending files in government departments must be done away with. I have told my officials to clear files as fast as possible so that citizens do not feel humiliated by running door-to-door in Dispur to get their work done,\" he said., The chief minister also highlighted the Modi government's flagship schemes like Skill India to empower youths and how it will help Assam.

Many pages are found blank and there are lots of inconsistencies in the serial numbers,\" he stated., Quoting a judgment pronounced by former Chief Justice of the Assam and Nagaland High Court, P.K. Goswami, Saha said: \"This document (NRC 1951) is not a public document within the meaning of Section 74 of the Indian Evidence Act... The National Register of Citizens is a contemporaneous register prepared by the officers under the Census Act in the course of census operations. If so, Section 15 of the Census Act will make such records of census not open to inspection for admissible evidence.\", Saha said the judgment clearly mentioned that the NRC was a confidential document but the Assam government, in contravention of the legal injunction, had made it public., The National Register of Citizens contains the details of all Indian citizens. According to the current modalities, it is being updated in Assam based on NRC 1951, electoral rolls up to the midnight of March 24, 1971 and in their absence the list of admissible documents of pre-March 24, 1971 period., The general secretary of the committee, Bidhayak Das Purkayastha, claimed that the electoral rolls of 1971 were also incomplete and full of errors., \"The voter lists of 1952, 1957, 1962, 1965 are not available on the official website of NRC. There are many districts where NRC 1951 is not available while the voter lists of 1966 and 1971 have errors.

He threatened to draw the attention of the Supreme Court on the issue., Though Gogoi immediately dubbed the allegations as baseless and politically motivated, the chief minister today, for the first time, challenged Ajmal to prove his allegation during the inauguration of a workshop on NRC update at Rajiv Bhawan, the state Congress headquarters here this morning., The Assam PCC had organised the workshop to sensitise and train its leaders and workers on how to help the citizens to apply for the NRC update without hassle., Appreciating the #PCC for organising the workshop at a time when various organisations are protesting against alleged anomalies in the process of updating the NRC, Gogoi alleged that the Opposition parties like the AIUDF and the BJP are only playing politics for their narrow political gains., \"Does Ajmal have the list of 40 lakh Muslims whom the government is trying to brand as Bangladeshis? Forget about 40 lakhs; let Ajmal give me the list of 40,000. If not 40,000 can Ajmal give me the names of 400? If not 400 let Ajmal name 40. If that is also not possible, let him name four persons,\" Gogoi said amidst applause from the party workers and leaders., The NRC is a document containing names of Indian citizens and was prepared in 1951.

            "The reign of unreason - Telegraph India$ 19.12.19$There have been many protests against the citizenship (amendment) bill (now Act), and there will be many more. This piece of legislation strikes at the heart of the Constitution, seeking to make India another country altogether. It is thus that so many people from so many different walks of life have raised their voices against it., Among these dissenting voices are Indian scientists, a normally apolitical community not known to organize collective campaigns of protest on matters of public interest. Some thousand-odd faculty members and doctoral students, working in our leading academic institutions, signed a petition against the bill as it was being presented in Parliament. Their petition stated — “The idea of India that emerged from the independence movement, and as enshrined in our constitution, is that of a country that aspires to treat people of all faiths equally. The use of religion as a criterion for citizenship in the proposed bill would mark a radical break with this history and would be inconsistent with the basic structure of the constitution. We fear, in particular, that the careful exclusion of Muslims from the ambit of the Bill will greatly strain the pluralistic fabric of the country.” The scientists asked for “the immediate withdrawal of this bill and as its replacement request for appropriate legislation that will address the concerns of refugees and minorities in a non-discriminatory manner.”, The signatories to the petition included several Fellows of the Royal Society (the most prestigious scientific body in the world, of which only a handful of Indians are members), Directors of our few world-class research institutes, and Professors and PhD scholars from all the Indian Institutes of Technology. , Although himself a historian, this writer comes from a family of scientists. In my own research career, I have had the privilege of working closely, and over a period of 35 years, with some of the finest minds in Indian science. From this experience, I can say that the statement is unprecedented. For these are not JNU jholawalas or human rights activists or left-leaning creative artists, who organize and participate in signature campaigns with unfailing regularity. That so many scientists, respected and established as well as talented and emerging, have come together to protest about a law in public is very striking indeed., Notably, the signatories have got support from someone who is arguably the most distinguished scientist of Indian-origin now alive, the Nobel laureate, Venkatraman (Venki) Ramakrishnan. He points out that discrimination based on religion is bad for science as well as for society. For “academics want an environment in which everybody is recognised based on their talent without prejudice, any discrimination, because science works best when everyone with the ability is allowed to contribute.” , In recent years, Professor Ramakrishnan has been coming regularly to the country where he was born and raised (and where he took his first degree, at the once excellent, now moribund, M.S. University of Baroda). He travels to India every year, gives talks across the country, attends conferences, and speaks to Indians of all ages and backgrounds. It is on the basis of this first-hand knowledge that he says: “Young people in India are very enterprising, working under difficult circumstances trying to do something, and what we don’t want is to be distracted from that mission of nation-building by creating divisions within the country.”, Like other scientists of distinction, Venki Ramakrishnan focuses on his research, and does not often venture into public debates. But, as he puts it, in this case, “I decided to speak out because although I live abroad I am extremely fond of India. I always think of India as representing a great tolerant ideal and I also want India to succeed.” He added: “I felt very strongly that telling 200 million people that ‘Look, your religion doesn’t actually have the same status as all the others’ is a very divisive message to the country.”, Already, top scientists working in India are dismayed at the ignorant falsehoods uttered on public platforms by our HRD minister (and our S&amp;T minister too). They worry about the increasing political interference in appointments to important posts. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act will confirm their fears that the climate for independent, original, scientific research will further shrink. , The country that has the best scientific infrastructure and the best scientists is the United States of America. That distinction once belonged to Germany. In his interview to The Telegraph, Venki Ramakrishnan notes: “Countries that have ideologies on science have ended up destroying their science. Essentially, German science took 50 years to recover from Hitler.” He could have added that Germany’s loss was American’s gain. For many of the best German scientists migrated to America, because of Hitler’s policies. , For science to truly flourish, a country must have a strong economic base; it must have State support for science; and the political climate must promote democracy and pluralism. America has all three of these things in abundance. India is struggling to nurture each one of them. Economic growth is stuttering because of the Narendra Modi government’s policies. The Modi government is deeply anti-intellectual. Now, with the passing of the CAA, democracy and pluralism are under threat as well. It is thus that these Indian scientists have taken the unprecedented step of a collective protest., In the 1970s, Indian science was far ahead of Chinese science. Now it is far behind. This is because the Chinese economy has grown much faster, and because in recent decades the Chinese State has actively promoted modern scientific research. Those who run Chinese science do not believe that Chinese scientists should take their clues from ancient Chinese thought. Xi Jinping would never consider appointing, as his ministers for education, the sort of incompetent individuals that Modi has. That is because — unlike Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party — Xi and the Chinese communist party understand that in the 21st century a country’s economic and political future depends vitally on the quality and autonomy of its scientific institutions., Authoritarianism is bad for scientific research. But bigotry may be even worse. Indian science will never live up to its potential, and India’s economy will never live up to its potential either, so long as we are ruled by politicians who believe that Hindus invented everything, and that Hindus are superior to Muslims., In the 1950s and the 1960s, many Indian scientists trained overseas came back to our country to work. They were animated by idealism, the desire to help in building a free and independent India. But they were also reassured by the political climate — our first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was committed to democracy and pluralism, and to modern science. , In later years, too, a fair number of scientists educated abroad returned to India. Although the attractions of life in the West were enormous, there were now a chain of fine scientific institutes within India that allowed one to do original research. Many of my own contemporaries did PhDs in Ivy League universities, and could easily have got jobs in Ivy League universities themselves. Yet they came back. But will their students?, Young Indian scientists now see Union ministers and even their prime minister claiming ancient Hindus knew how to produce test-tube babies, and design and fly aeroplanes. They see the Central government disregard the advice of expert scientific committees and seek to appoint Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh loyalists as vice-chancellors and directors of our best universities and research institutes. They see the police vandalize university libraries, something that never happened even under the British raj. If an opportunity comes to pursue their career in a country more conducive to scientific research, why would they stay in India?, One of the consequences of the CAA (and of Hindutva majoritarianism in general) will be that the brain drain will accelerate. Fewer and fewer Indian scientists educated abroad will want to come back to a land so strongly marked by sectarian prejudice. India’s loss will be America’s gain., The short (and medium) term prospects for Indian science are bleak. Nonetheless, one must be grateful that so many of our scientists have protested against a piece of legislation that is so manifestly discriminatory. A government that cares for the future of the country should listen to the best minds in Indian science. The Modi government will not, for it is both philistine and bigoted. However, history will vindicate the scientists. India needed them to speak out, and they did., ramachandraguha@yahoo.in\n",

Varma had met Nitish ahead of the parliamentary vote on CAA and publicly appealed to him to “reconsider” his support to what Varma considers a “divisive and destructive” legislation., Another senior partyman, JDU vice-president and political strategist, Prashant Kishor, too has spoken publicly against the CAA. Kishor has, however, been persuaded to stay on in the party on Nitish’s promise to him that the JDU will not support the push for a National Register of Citizens (NRC)., Varma, a career diplomat and writer, had taken premature retirement from the IFS to join Nitish Kumar in 2013. Since then, he had a spell as culture adviser to the Bihar chief minister and a two-year stint in the Rajya Sabha., Increasingly, though, Varma had become uncomfortable with Nitish’s closeness to the BJP, especially what he considered a strong drift towards sectarian politics. Varma has been openly critical of the Prime Minister’s dog-whistle remark from Jharkhand where he said those opposing the CAA can be recognised from “the clothes they wear”., Sources close to Varma said he may not have firmed up his future course but will continue efforts to “form an alternative”. They added that his position in the JDU has become “unsustainable” on account of the party’s alliance with the BJP, whose leadership Varma is “unequivocally and strongly disapproving and critical” of.\n",

            "‘No word on Bangladeshis yet’ - Telegraph India$ 17.12.19$New Delhi has not of late informed Dhaka of the presence of any Bangladeshi staying illegally in India, Gowher Rizvi, international affairs adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, said on Tuesday., “India hasn’t told us about the presence of Bangladeshis after the list that has been prepared,” Rizvi said in Calcutta while referring to an assurance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Bangladesh needn’t worry about the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India as it would not affect the neighbouring country. “The issue of NRC is an internal matter of India,” Rizvi said., The Bangladeshi historian and scholar did not specify which list he was referring to. The final NRC for Assam, published on August 30, had excluded over  19 lakh people., Out of these, nearly 12 lakh are said to be Hindus — the primary reason the BJP has rejected the final register although the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, is yet to rule on the fate of the data collected so far., Rizvi’s statement assumes significance as Dhaka has already said it will take back whoever India can prove is a Bangladeshi citizen. “But it has to be proven that the person is Bangladeshi,” Rizvi underscored on Tuesday., The comment is an extension of what Bangladeshi foreign minister A.K. Abdul Momen had said on Sunday. Momen had said that the country was willing to take back illegal immigrants, but India has to hand over the list of such persons first.  , Drawing up a list of Bangladeshis in India with proof that they are from the neighbouring country will be a Herculean task, said a retired diplomat who did not wish to be identified. “This is Dhaka’s way of castling Delhi,” the veteran diplomat added. , BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah,  have been repeatedly asserting that “ghushpetiyas (infiltrators)” from neighbouring countries would be identified and driven out., On Tuesday said:  “The issue of NRC is an internal matter of India…. The Prime Minister of India has given us assurance that we don’t need to worry about it as it will not affect us.”, Sources in Dhaka had said that the repeated mention of “infiltrators” from Bangladesh – and that too bracketing them with people from Pakistan and Afghanistan – had hurt many in the policy establishment in the neighbouring country. , Last week, when Dhaka cancelled scheduled India visits by two senior members of Hasina cabinet –  Momen and home minister Asaduzzaman Khan – diplomatic sources linked it to growing displeasure in the ruling Awami League establishment over the manner in which Bangladesh has been mentioned by Indian leaders. , Shah, in his address in Parliament during the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, spoke about persecution of minority communities in neighbouring countries – and mentioned Islamic countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan in the same breath – to justify the Indian legislation that excludes Muslims., In his reply to questions on what the Hasina government felt about the NRC and the amended citizenship law, Rizvi repeatedly mentioned that Bangladesh followed “democratic, plural, socialist and secular” principles that the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had adopted.  “People in our country are never discriminated on the basis of their religion,” he said. , The stress on absence of any discrimination is significant in the backdrop of the main criticism of the amended law for being discriminatory., On the amended citizenship law, Rizvi’s response was guarded. “As we understand, a new law has been enacted.

            "Celebrate the Nobel, not the attire of Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo - Telegraph India$ 17.12.19$Sir — Many Indians are celebrating the fact that Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee attended the Nobel Prize ceremony in traditional Indian attire. But such jubilation, especially when it comes to Duflo’s choice of clothing, is meaningless. The economist could have chosen her apparel based on a number of reasons, not the least of which could be that her Nobel-winning work is based on the Indian context. Interpreting this as a triumph of our culture is just a symptom of the growing preoccupation with ‘national supremacy’. Instead of harping on misguided connections, we should celebrate Duflo’s work and reflect upon what it reveals about our economy., Debaparna Biswas, Calcutta, Look deeper, Sir — Now that the citizenship (amendment) bill has been passed by both Houses of Parliament, India has a new citizenship law in place. The right-wing brigade might have declared the occasion of the bill’s passage a gold-lettered day, but in reality it was a dark day for the nation. The new law marks a retreat from the notion of religious plurality that India has cherished for ages. The law has disappointed citizens who believed that India could remain secular even after the Bharatiya Janata Party assumed power at the Centre. India now has the dubious distinction of being a country with a secular Constitution but with laws that abet religious discrimination., The new citizenship law brings about a fundamental change in India’s inclusive image. No amount of rationalization by pro-BJP legal luminaries and television anchors can justify this religious discrimination: it is a blotch on the Indian democracy that this law bars only Muslims from seeking refuge in India. A landscape dotted with ‘detention camps’ for the members of a particular religious community will only show that the world’s largest democracy espouses religious intolerance., Secularism is the talisman that keeps the nation together. Hindutva, stained with upper-caste supremacy, cannot substitute secularism in maintaining national unity. Allowing citizenship based on domicile on the Indian soil is the only way forward. One hopes that the Supreme Court will rule the new law unconstitutional, declaring it null and void., G. David Milton, Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu, Sir — The Citizenship (Amendment) Act has begun spreading its venom among the people. It has not only ignited hatred against Muslims but also led to outbursts of anger in several parts of the country. Following the Partition, India witnessed a number of conflicts and riots before a semblance of peace was established. This calm persisted for a number of years. Although illegal immigration has always been a problem in the country, there had been an appreciable equipoise. But the BJP was clearly not fond of this state of balance. It therefore threatened parts of the population with expulsion from their motherland., The BJP seems to have deviated from its earlier agenda. It had previously claimed that it would throw out all illegal immigrants and, to this end, it introduced the National Register of Citizens in Assam. Now, with the CAA, the party has made it clear that migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, from all religions but Islam, will be granted Indian citizenship. This means that the problem of infiltration will remain, as illegal immigrants from non-Islamic lineages will now be given the legal licence to enter India. Then, the main goal of the CAA and the NRC is only to foment religious polarization. This is clearly a rerun of the ‘divide-and-rule’ policy, and part of the BJP’s political game plan., Purushottam Chakraborty, Calcutta, Sir — The CAA, which deprives Muslims of the right to seek citizenship, is discriminatory. It violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution. By prioritizing the enactment of laws like the NRC and the CAA, the BJP is trying to divert attention from other important issues by harping on illegal migration. Real problems faced by the people include the country reaching its highest level of unemployment in 45 years, the skyrocketing price of onions and the decelerating growth rate. These seem to be matters that the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah government cannot handle. If enough tension is created with the CAA and the NRC, it will keep the Opposition and the people so focused on identity issues that the hunger of the poor and the despair over joblessness will be shelved for now., S.S. Paul, Nadia , Sir — It is surprising that many people of the Hindu community seem to be happy about the CAA. This is in spite of the fact that they — those who have so far comprised the electorate — are being burdened with proving their citizenship. Upon failing to do this, they, too, might be considered illegal immigrants and detained. Further, if proper procedure is followed, even non-Islamic refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who have been promised legal entry to India, may find it difficult to submit evidence of their ‘persecution’, which is the stipulation for gaining citizenship under the CAA., Jitendra Singh , Jamshedpur\n",

He said the names of his son Nazir Ahmed and daughter Moriyam did not appear in the list while his other married daughter Rahima’s name was there. He said he would fight legally., Majharbhuiya was elected to the Assam Legislative Assembly in 2006 and 2011 on an AIUDF ticket.

            "19.06 lakh people out of NRC is too low, say proponents - Telegraph India$ 31.08.19$AASU's Bhattacharya called it a failure of all political parties in Delhi or Dispur. He said the parties were unsuccessful in implementing the Assam Accord of 1985. “Detection, deletion, deportation or sealing of the border, nothing has been done by the successive governments,” said Bhattacharya., In May 1997, Indrajit Gupta, then home minister, had reportedly said there were more than 10 million “illegal immigrants” living in India, of which 40 lakh were in Assam. In a 1998 report, the then Assam governor Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha wrote: “The influx of these illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region.”, In 2004, then minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal told the Rajya Sabha that Assam had over 50 lakh “illegal Bangladeshi migrants”., Today’s NRC publication showed a much lower figure and that has upset the organisations., “We feel that there may be an error in the process and that the updating process is not complete,” Bhattacharya said. “For that, we have decided to go to the Supreme court for remedy. We have full faith in the Supreme Court.”, BJP minister in Assam Himanta Biswa Sarma also trashed the NRC results and demanded a re-verification of all the districts in Assam., #NRCAssamI reiterate that as requested by Central and State governments at least 20% reverification (bordering districts) and 10% re-verification(remaining districts) should be allowed by Honble Apex court for a correct and fair NRC. 2/2, The proponents of the NRC in Assam are all unhappy because 19.06 lakh people being kept out of citizenship is too low a number compared to earlier estimates given by various ministers in different reports. , The All Assam Students Union, the students' body behind the movement, the Assam Public Works, an NGO that was the original petitioner in the Supreme Court, and the Sachetan Nagarik Mancha, an organisation of retired government officials and thinkers, all fumed today., “We’re not using the word oppose,” Samujjal Bhattacharya, the AASU’s chief adviser, said. “Today’s figure is not close to the already declared figures by the government of India or Assam at different times. We had expected more and we are not happy.”,  , The NRC process has been closely monitored by the Supreme Court since 2013, but questions were raised about the process, the acceptance of documents, the software used and the court-appointed NRC state coordinator Prateek Hajela.,  , Aabhijit Sarma, the Assam Public Works president, said he repeatedly requested the Supreme Court for a reverification and even filed petitions but the state coordinator suggested to the apex court that there isn’t a need for one.,  , The Nagarik Mancha’s Chandan Bhattacharjya said all the blame was Hajela's. “We want an investigation of the software used in the NRC process.

            "Coronavirus: The Kerala model can be emulated to deal with migrant labourers during Covid-19 pandemic - Telegraph India$ 29.04.20$A three-week long nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. An unintended consequence of the lockdown unfolded soon with thousands of migrant labourers thronging several bus and rail stations in the hope of reaching home. The republic still does not know how many of them walked how many kilometres or the adversities that they encountered. What the country was left with were some images that are going to haunt it for a long time., We have no means of estimating the numbers of these migrants barring some ambiguous figures released on migration. Despite the claims of inclusive vikas, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed the colossal failure of the numerous social security programmes that are meant to help people at the bottom of the pyramid. Census 2011 pegged the figure of internal migration in India at 455 million, a net addition of 141 million migrants between 2001 and 2011. Out of the total number of migrants, 54.26 million people are inter-state migrants. Of these, more than 12.5 million people migrated for work/employment., The share of the eastern region in the total number of inter-state migrants is around 24.8 per cent (13.5 million). For employment-related reasons, the share is more than 29.9 per cent (3.74 million). At the national level as well as in the eastern region, Bihar is one of the leading suppliers of inter-state migrants (7.45 million), out of whom 2.26 million migrated for work/employment. The second position is occupied by West Bengal, which was traditionally a net recipient till 2001. But in the 2011 census, Bengal suddenly emerged as the net sender with a volume of inter-state migrants of 2.40 million. This state also pushed around 6 lakh people to migrate to other states for work or employment-related reasons. It is followed by Jharkhand (1.70 million), Odisha (1.27 million) and Assam (6.59 lakh). There are references in the speeches of ministers, including those by the prime minister, about the eastern part of the country being poorer and lagging behind in development. However, there has been no policy intervention on the part of the Centre to ensure that the region develops at the same pace as the west, north and south., Where do the migrants migrate? An analyses of favourable destination states for migrants from this region would reveal the National Capital Region of Delhi (5.16 lakh), Maharashtra (5.22 lakh), Gujarat (3.4 lakh), Uttar Pradesh (2.30 lakh), Haryana (2.03 lakh), Punjab (1.75 lakh) and Karnataka (1.23 lakh). A state-wise break-up of the figures indicate that the NCR is a favoured destination for the Bihari migrants. It absorbed more than 4 lakh workers. One lakh forty thousand migrant labourers entered Maharashtra from Bengal. Most of the migrants from Jharkhand, Odisha and Assam entered neighbouring West Bengal but the pull of other distant states has also been noticeable in recent times. , These were some figures available on migrant workers. However, the data, collected in 2011 and released in 2019, are limited in a myriad ways. For instance, the data are limited in scope as they only reveal state-wise figures, concealing the source districts or blocks from where these migrant labourers had moved to their favoured destinations. In the absence of any data based on migrants both at source and destination, the states are finding it difficult to reconcile with the situation. Ironically, the Central government that has been insisting on the enumeration of citizens through the National Register of Citizens has thwarted the unbiased collection of official statistics for welfare measures. For example, recent surveys on migration by the NSSO are absent. The last round of enumeration by the National Sample Survey Office was conducted in 2007-08., The Kerala model can be emulated to deal with migrant labourers. The state has conducted regular surveys on migration since 1998, shedding light on the various issues concerning migration and mobility based on a large-scale sample of 15,000 households. The findings of the survey could be the basis of welfare programmes during a crisis such as this pandemic. The Covid-19 crisis has, once again, forced us to think about the need for not only a humane approach towards those who are the engines of our cities but also proper policy, including reliable ways of counting India’s ‘people on the move’.\n",

However the place has been demarcated to be used as a quarantine centre,” Ray said., He categorically quashed rumours that this quarantine area was envisaged keeping in mind a specific community. “When the place will be used as a quarantine centre it will be for everyone,” Ray said., Constructed at an expenditure of Rs 55 crore, Haj House at Kadru is the biggest of its kind of eastern India. Former CM Raghubar Das had inaugurated it last year in June.\n",

            "Coronovirus: state of people held in NRC detention camps in Assam and rest of India - Telegraph India$ 01.04.20$India, especially New India, loves to lock up people. The exercise of updating the National Register of Citizens in Assam — meant to be carried out all over the country, according to the Union home minister — resulted in the incarceration in detention camps of those excluded from the register as ‘declared foreigners’. The detention camps are housed within prisons, while a new one is being built in Goalpara. These are dark spaces in India’s everyday life, inhabited by people who are remembered only by their families. Of those already detained, 29 died before the attack of Covid-19; most of their bodies, ironically, had to be handed over to their kin in India because no connections could be traced beyond the country’s borders. A rights group, the Justice and Liberty Initiative, has petitioned the Supreme Court to order bail for ‘declared foreigners’. A humane approach — peculiarly missing among India’s powerful — would demand that they be protected in their homes, not exposed to contagion in unhygienic, closed spaces and, should they fall ill, it should not be in prison., In the appeal, the JLI referred to a truly humane order of the Supreme Court. The court has asked states and Union territories to consider releasing prisoners on parole and those awaiting trial for offences entailing a maximum sentence of seven years in order to reduce crowding in prisons in case of infection. The court’s move — some states are in the process of complying — underlines a persistent misuse of the law. Lower courts and investigative agencies routinely violate the individual’s right to bail; the huge number of undertrial prisoners is evidence of India’s general indifference to the legal and constitutional rights of the poor and vulnerable. The forced release of prisoners — that may cause other problems — seems to be a hard lesson in lawfulness and ethics being taught by a virus should anyone wish to learn it for the future. Humaneness, however, is a difficult lesson for Indians. Another rights group is asking the authorities that the detention camp being built in Goalpara to house ‘declared foreigners’ be used now as a hospital for quarantining and isolating Covid-19 sufferers. It would save money, energy and space if the building could be used for healing, not punishment. Beyond all this lie the psychiatric hospitals, where patients are reportedly often left naked, chained and starving in normal times. Are they being protected from the virus?\n",

In fact, he has been acquitted in all the cases in Assam as there is no evidence on the charges put on him. Despite this, the Dibrugarh police camped in Sivasagar and took him to Dibrugarh,” Bora said. , Akhil was granted bail in the Sivasagar case on Saturday and in a case (290/19) lodged with Chabua police station in Dibrugarh on Tuesday. However, the hearing of another case (289/19) lodged at Chabua police station is pending, so he was arrested by Dibrugarh police immediately after he was released from Sivasagar jail on Wednesday. , Bora alleged, “It is the government which is doing this. It has put democracy at risk. We will not blame the police. At the time of global pandemic, they (the government) are also harassing police personnel by compelling them to do these things.”, He also alleged that no arrest memo was given to them while taking Akhil to Dibrugarh and demanded an arrest warrant and arrest memo., Dibrugarh superintendent of police Sreejith T. told The Telegraph that they had arrested Akhil 10 days ago but he was kept at Sivasagar jail in connection with a police case in that district. Since he had been granted bail in that case, he was brought to Dibrugarh. Proceedings are on, he added., He said an arrest memo is the right of an arrested person and it will “eventually” be given to Akhil’s counsel., Reacting to the move, leader of the Opposition in the Assam Assembly Debabrata Saikia said the government seemed to be unable to “forgive” Akhil for his alleged opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). He condemned Dispur’s “relentless attempts” to keep Akhil behind the bars even at the cost of flouting the manifest will of various courts of law, including the Supreme Court., “It seems the government is unable to forgive him for opposing the contentious CAA and is blatantly pursuing an agenda of vendetta,” Saikia said., Akhil has been in judicial custody since December 27, 2019, for alleged links with Maoists. , Akhil was first arrested by Assam police on December 12 last year from Jorhat and was then handed over to the NIA on December 17.\n",

However, the government of Assam is clearly adopting a contrary policy so far as Akhil Gogoi is concerned. It seems the government is unable to forgive him for opposing the contentious CAA and is blatantly pursuing an agenda of vendetta.”, He added that the government is not prosecuting Akhil, but rather is “persecuting” him. , Saikia said Akhil was granted bail in the case registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as the investigative agency had failed to come up with sufficient evidence against the KMSS leader even after 90 days of incarceration and investigation., He has by now secured bail in various cases filed by the crime branch, Sivasagar police and Dibrugarh police., He termed this “attitude” of the state government as not only undemocratic, but is tantamount to contempt of court, in his opinion., He demanded that Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who holds the home portfolio, should immediately instruct officials of all relevant police stations to forthwith desist from harassing Akhil and also instruct Sivasagar police to escort him to his home with due health-care precautions in view of the ongoing lockdown.\n",

Ek baar aankh khol kar, TV chala kar, phir se aap ka bhashan dekh lo Mamatadi. Ghuspethiyon ke liye aap kya keh rahi thi aur aaj kya keh rahi ho (for once open your eyes, switch on your TV and watch your speech again, Mamatadi. Watch what you had said about infiltrators then and what are you saying today),” Shah said smiling., “I have come today to assure the people of Bengal. I have come to assure all refugees – Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, and Christians – especially the Hindu refugees because their numbers are high, that they will not be asked to leave India,” he thundered., All through the speech, the BJP chief used 'sharanarthi (asylum seeker)' to refer to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Jain migrants from other countries. The citizenship amendment bill will protect their rights, Shah assured them. But there were others - the 'ghuspethis (infiltrators)' - whom Shah did not name, but there is little doubt that he meant Muslims. , If it was unclear to anyone the 'ghuspethi' was, the context behind Mamata's rage in the Lok Sabha on August 4, 2005, made it clear.,  , That day, the Trinamul chief hurled a sheaf of papers at the Speaker’s chair when she wasn’t allowed to raise the subject of illegal Bangladeshi migrants. Deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal was in the chair when it happened.,  , According to a report by The Telegraph that same day, Mamata had said in the House: “Illegal migrants from Bangladesh are also part of the voters’ list in West Bengal. The state government has done nothing about it. Therefore, the issue must be discussed.”, Mamata then accused the Speaker -- the CPM’s Somnath Chatterjee -- of being politically biased and said that “whenever I want to raise an issue, I am not allowed to speak.” Her comment was expunged. ,  , But what couldn’t be expunged in the age of television was the visual of Mamata throwing papers at the Deputy Speaker. This led to an uproar in the House with protests from members of the Left parties, which is recorded in the session's archives on the Lok Sabha website. ,  , “She should come and apologise before the House,” CPM leader and then Jadavpur MP Sujan Chakraborty said, calling her action a deliberate insult to the Lok Sabha. ,  , Mamata later 'resigned' and left the Lok Sabha. She told reporters that there was no point in being a member of the House if she was not allowed to raise people's issues.,  , Later, Somnath addressed the issue from the chair. “I was not here when some incident happened but I had the occasion to see the television footage on this,” he said. “It has been attributed to me that I have taken a decision on the basis of my political affiliation. I wish to strongly refute it.” He also rejected the resignation because it wasn’t a proper quit letter.,  , Shah today claimed Mamata was misleading Hindu refugees by saying that they would have to leave if the NRC was implemented in the state. Mamata has publicly opposed an NRC-like exercise in Bengal. Recent deaths in some Bengal districts have been attributed to the dread surrounding the NRC, a citizenship verification exercise done in Assam that has left 19 lakh people there stateless., Since the release of the NRC, a view has gained ground that many who are not on the list in Assam are Hindus and the citizenship amendment bill would be brought by the Centre to safeguard their rights, but at the same time it would leave out Muslims facing banishment to detention camps., Shah today said there cannot be a greater lie than Mamata's stand on the NRC.\n",

So Amit Shahji will give us a clear picture over the issue and dispel all fears and misconceptions,' a senior state BJP leader said., In Assam, the only state in the country where the exercise was carried out to update the NRC, names of over 19 lakh people were omitted from the final list which was published on August 31. Of them about 12 lakh are Hindus., NRC was one of the provisions of the Assam Accord of 1985 and was carried out under the supervision of the Supreme Court., The omission of a large number of Hindu Bengalis from the final NRC list in BJP-ruled Assam has apparently created panic among the people and has allegedly led to eleven deaths in the state so far., 'The TMC has been opposing NRC to protect Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators who are its vote bank in West Bengal. But after many Hindus were omitted from the NRC final list in Assam, it is trying to project us as anti-Hindu and an anti-refugee party. This might take a toll on our prospects in Bengal,' said a senior state BJP leader, who did not wish to be named., Trinamul has been against the updation of the NRC calling it an 'anti-Bengali' move by the BJP., Meanwhile, TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee, has demanded that Shah and BJP leadership clarify the exclusion of a large number of Hindus in the final NRC list in Assam., 'BJP has been speaking on implementation of NRC to throw out infiltrators. It should first clarify why such a large number of Hindus were omitted from the NRC list in Assam. Are those Hindus who were omitted from the (NRC) list, infiltrators? BJP should clarify,' he said., The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, provides for according Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after seven years of residence in India instead of 12 years, which is the current norm, even if they do not possess any document. The legislation was passed by Lok Sabha during its winter session on January 8 but could not be cleared by the upper house., Some senior BJP leaders have said that the bill would be reintroduced in the winter session of Parliament., Banerjee, who had met Shah earlier this month in the national capital over the matter, has been building strong public opinion against the NRC exercise., The TMC supremo had led a rally against NRC on September 12 in the city., The West Bengal Assembly had in August passed a resolution against NRC and Banerjee had vowed not to allow its implementation in Bengal.\n",

It is the government’s responsibility to ensure their safety and safeguard their rights and interests,” he said, as the crowd cheered., Talking about the government’s vision for growth and development, Sonowal said the Barak Valley has a lot of potential and resources and is a vital part of the state. , “Mini-secretariat’s work has already started. Citizens here will be immensely benefited after the project gets completed. Various other initiatives will be taken for the valley’s all-round development in the days ahead,” he said., Social welfare minister Pramila Rani Brahma said the government gives immense importance to women, their empowerment, growth and welfare. , “Educating women is a stepping-stone towards a strong and prosperous nation,” she said., She heaped praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts towards the welfare of women. Prevention of malnutrition among women is a remarkable move towards a better society, she added., Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy said Modi’s Poshan Abhiyan initiative had created a revolution across the country. He said the male-female ratio was disproportionate over the past several years but the scenario improved substantially after the scheme was launched., He said the country has a rich history and has witnessed women in highly esteemed positions like those of the President and the Prime Minister. “They (women) have proved themselves everywhere,” he said, encouraging a huge gathering of women, who had come to attend the event., Silchar MLA Dilip Kumar Paul, Barkhola MLA Kishore Nath, Udharbond MLA Mihir Kanti Shome, former minister Kabindra Purkayastha, deputy Speaker Aminul Haque Laskar and Cachar deputy commissioner Laya Madduri attended the event.\n",

Most of them returned home with appointments dating to more than three years in the future., “I left my job for three days to stand in the queue. But today they gave me a slip asking me to come back in three years. I might not be in the country by then,” Sabiya said., “My slip says 2022. But what if the NRC comes and goes by then and my name is not on the list?” Asgar asked., Staff at the Aurangabad post office, numbering three including the postmaster, said they were compelled to take the unusual measure of providing slips in order to prevent law-and-order problems., “Thousands are queuing up here everyday, and the matter, which is linked to the NRC, is of utmost importance to them,” said a postal worker., “We are issuing slips to 30 people a day. Within four days, all the working dates in this year and the next year were booked. Now we are giving dates of October 2022. If we continue this process, we will now have to allot dates in 2023,” he added., The postal staff said they could not handle more than 30 cases a day because of the workforce crunch and the fully computerised Aadhaar system with which the staff were still getting acclimatised. , On Wednesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee released a video in which she asked the citizens of the state “not to worry”, saying that “an NRC-like exercise is not on the cards in Bengal”., In East Burdwan’s Galsi, at least 100 families have been camping in front of a nationalised bank branch, which hosts an Aadhaar centre, from the early hours. Similar queues have been spotted in front of land records offices, EPIC card correction centres and food supply (ration card) offices. , “We cannot ignore the repeated assertions by BJP leaders that they will conduct an NRC drive in Bengal,” said a resident of Aurangabad., The postal superintendent of Murshidabad, Prabal Bagchi, said on Aurangabad: “The post office can’t distribute such slips.

            "Modi government 2.0: In 2,300 words, Congress avoids 2  - Telegraph India$ 31.05.20$The Congress on Saturday said the Narendra Modi government appeared to be at war with the people of India in the first year of its second term, inflicting wounds instead of healing them., “It is somewhat surprising that they still haven’t grasped the most fundamental lesson of governance in a democracy: we are elected to serve, listen, protect and uplift. Not to divide, mislead and distract. The sooner this government realises that, the better it will be for the nation and for their own place in its history,” the Congress said in a statement., Questioning the BJP’s decision to celebrate the completion of one year amid the worst humanitarian crisis the country was grappling with, the Congress statement said: “Over the past six years, India witnessed a steady increase in the politics of distraction and false noise, to the point that it has become a defining mainstay of the Modi government’s administrative style. While it served the political interests of the BJP, it came at an unprecedented economic and social cost to the nation.”, While the 2,300-word statement talks of inflicting newer wounds on the body polity, it doesn’t mention the removal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), two defining features of Modi’s second term that had shaken India., India never witnessed such prolonged and widespread agitation, involving students, activists, artistes, intellectuals and common citizens in almost every state and district against the CAA., Even the Congress lent its support to the movement, organising public reading of the preamble to the Constitution across the country. , That, coupled with the Kashmir policy, was largely viewed as the beginning of mass revulsion against the undemocratic functioning of the Modi government but the Congress appears to have forgotten that chapter., Whether the preoccupation with the ongoing humanitarian crisis caused the glaring omission or the party does not want to lay emphasis on emotive issues that enable the BJP divide the society on religious lines is difficult to fathom. , The party has otherwise compiled every single issue since 2014, the beginning of Modi’s first term, from the promise that suggested everyone can be Rs 15 lakh each to bringing back the black money, from doubling the farmers’ income to creating 2 crore jobs every year., The unusually long statement dwelt on a wide range of concerns:  demonetisation, bank frauds, high-profile fugitives, subjugation of democratic institutions, violation of federal principles, terror attacks, the recording of a TV show featuring Modi at Jim Corbett National Park during the Pulwama attack, unemployment, the fall of rupee, interest rate cuts and no press conference by the Prime Minister., Although the general secretary in-charge of organisation, K.C. Venugopal, contended that the second term was “an extreme version” of the first, the key attributes of the second term, when Amit Shah as home minister drove the bulldozer, were omitted., Party’s communication chief Randeep Surjewala termed the second term as Modi 0.2 instead of Modi 2.0, arguing that the absence of good governance compelled him to say so., He said: “Modiji asks the Opposition whether they are with the government or not in this phase of crisis. We are with the people, not the government.” , Our job is to raise the concerns of the people who are facing a cruel government which is inflicting wounds on them. Modiji suddenly talks of self-reliance., “When the dignity of the workers is being trampled on the road, when the government is indulging in betrayal and self-publicity, we have to stand with the people.”, Asked about BJP president J.P. Nadda’s accusation that the Congress was playing politics, Surjewala said: “It is better Nadda answered questions about the PPE scam in his own state Himachal and the ventilator scam in Gujarat. He should also explain what the government was doing when Rahul Gandhi repeatedly alerted it about Covid. Why did they waste time in organising Namaste Trump programme and pulling down the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh? He should explain what the achievements are of four lockdowns and what the plan is for the future.”\n",

The petitioner fleeing from justice is also not ruled out.” , A popular speaker at protests against the Centre’s new citizenship matrix, 19-year-old Amulya had chanted “Pakistan zindabad” thrice on stage during the February 21 public meeting in Bangalore but added “Hindustan zindabad” in the same breath in keeping with her belief that good things should happen to all countries., The police had dragged her off the stage and bundled her into a van before she could explain what she was trying to say., She was booked under several non-bailable offences, primarily sedition.

            "Ideal space and reason - Telegraph India$ 18.02.20$It is not dissent or peaceful protest that is anti-democratic, but the destruction of the spaces for protest that goes against deliberative democracy. In a lecture luminous with reason, the Supreme Court judge, D.Y. Chandrachud, criticized the blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national. It is an assault on the heart of democracy, he said in effect, while the use of State machinery to instil fear and suppress free speech is a violation of constitutional values. The duty of a government, it could be inferred from his words, is to protect the space for dissent and dismantle all forces that threaten it — precisely the opposite of what the Narendra Modi-led government has been doing. The irony of the judge’s allusions could not have escaped even the most hardened Hindutva champion. The makers of the Constitution rejected a Hindu India and a Muslim India and believed only in the republic of India. No individual or institution can claim a monopoly on the idea of India; the most successful democracy is the one in which all voices are heard and no voice is strangled. Two days earlier, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court had said that the Constitution had given the people the rule of law and not the rule of the majority. Peaceful protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act cannot be termed anti-national. , In the context of the undaunted anti-CAA protests of the people countrywide, these statements carry especial weight. Difference is not India’s weakness, but its strength, said the judge. Pluralism is the constitutional vision; the existence of India is a triumph of pluralism and diversity. The Bombay High Court, too, emphasized that different needs may cause different groups of people to protest, even against the government. Accommodating difference and participating in the exchange of opinion as equals in a shared pursuit of happiness emerged as the ideal of a deliberative and evolving democracy in the judge’s speech. Central to this is the exercise of reason, or intellect. The judge said that the suppression of the intellect is the suppression of the nation’s conscience. In these days of cow worship, lynching, loud lies and sustained efforts at polarization, the call to reason is also a call to conscience. Protesters braving the weather and State bullying bear this out.\n"
